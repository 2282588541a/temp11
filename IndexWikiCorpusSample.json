        "text": "Anders Venger (5 January 1872 \u2013 23 February 1935) was a Norwegian politician of the Conservative Party. He served Minister of Agriculture from 1923 to 1924, Minister of Labour from March to July 1926 and acting Minister of Education and Church Affairs from November to December 1923 following the death of Ivar Bergersen S\u00e6len. He also served as deputy leader of the Conservative Party from 1920 to 1925.\nEarly life.\nAnders Venger grew up at Venjerbakken, one of Eidsvoll's oldest properties at the time. The farm was located on the west side of Vorma, close to Eidsvoll Verk and the industrial area B\u00f8n. Venger was the son of Marte Olava Aas (1848\u20131907) and Johan A. Venger (1846\u20131921). His father, who had bought Venjerbakken in 1873, was also active in municipal politics in Eidsvoll. \nPolitics.\nVenger was elected mayor of Eidsvoll in 1912 and assumed the position in 1913. He held this post for 21 years until 1934, though he was on leave while he served as government minister. \nHe entered the Storting in 1919, elected as a representative from the constituency of \u00d8vre Romerike. He was re-elected until 1927, when he choose not to run for re-election due to the impeachment proceedings against former prime minister Abraham Berge. During that same time frame, he also resigned as Minister of Labour in 1926. \nVenger had also served as Minister of Agriculture and Otto Bahr Halvorsen's second cabinet and continued in the same post after Abraham Berge took over after Bahr Halvorsen's death in May 1923. As agriculture minister, he was able to pass farmer friendly bill regarding corn arrangements. \nFor many years, Venger was an active member of the Conservative central executive committee, and he also served five years as the party's deputy leader. He was considered to be a part of the party's agrarian wing, whom, during the 1920s, were in conflict with city liberals, where they disagreed on the party's agricultural policy."

        "text": "Tintern Abbey was a Cistercian abbey located on the Hook Peninsula, County Wexford, Ireland.\nThe Abbey \u2013 which is today in ruins, some of which have been restored \u2013 was founded in c.1200 by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, as the result of a vow he had made when his boat was caught in a storm nearby. While the specific date of foundation is unconfirmed in some sources, in a 1917 analysis for the Royal Irish Academy, church historian J. H. Bernard suggests a foundation date of 3 December 1200.\nOnce established, the abbey was colonised by monks from the Cistercian abbey at Tintern in Monmouthshire, Wales, of which Marshal was also patron. To distinguish the two, the mother house in Wales was sometimes known as \"Tintern Major\" and the abbey in Ireland as \"Tintern de Voto\" (Tintern of the vow).\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey and its grounds were granted firstly to Sir James Croft, and then in 1575 to Anthony Colclough of Staffordshire, a soldier of Henry VIII. His descendants became the Colclough Baronets. The final member of the Colclough family to reside at Tintern was Lucey Marie Biddulph Colclough and, after she left in 1959, the Irish state started conservation and consolidation works on the site. \nBetween 1982 and 2007, the National Monuments service of the Office of Public Works undertook a number of excavation and heritage development efforts at the abbey, including special conservation measures for local bat colonies. Additional works were undertaken after a fire in the site's visitor centre in 2012, which damaged part of the 19th century outbuildings on the abbey's grounds."

        "title": "Portrait of a Musician",
        "text": "The Portrait of a Musician is an unfinished painting widely attributed to the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to . Produced while Leonardo was in Milan, the work is painted in oils, and perhaps tempera, on a small panel of walnut wood. It is his only known male portrait painting, and the identity of its sitter has been closely debated among scholars.\nPerhaps influenced by Antonello da Messina's introduction of the Early Netherlandish style of portrait painting to Italy, the work marks a dramatic shift from the profile portraiture that predominated in 15th-century Milan. It shares many similarities with other paintings Leonardo executed there, such as the Louvre \"Virgin of the Rocks\" and the \"Lady with an Ermine\", but the \"Portrait of a Musician\" is his only panel painting remaining in the city, where it has been in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana since at least 1672. One of Leonardo's best preserved paintings, there are no extant contemporary records of the commission. Based on stylistic resemblances to other works by Leonardo, virtually all current scholarship attributes at least the sitter's face to him. Uncertainty over the rest of the painting arises from the stiff and rigid qualities of the body, which are uncharacteristic of Leonardo's work. While this may be explained by the painting's unfinished state, some scholars believe that Leonardo was assisted by one of his students.\nThe portrait's intimacy indicates a private commission, or one by a personal friend. Until the 20th century it was thought to show Ludovico Sforza, a Duke of Milan and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding sheet music, indicating that the sitter was a musician. Many musicians active in Milan have been proposed as the sitter; Franchinus Gaffurius was the most favored candidate throughout the 20th century, but in the 21st century scholarly opinion shifted towards Atalante Migliorotti. Other notable suggestions include Josquin des Prez and Gaspar van Weerbeke, but there is no historical evidence to substantiate any of these claims. The work has been criticized for its stoic and wooden qualities, but noted for its intensity and the high level of detail in the subject's face. Scholarly interpretations range from the painting depicting a musician mid-performance, to representing Leonardo's self-proclaimed ideology of the superiority of painting over other art forms, such as music.\nDescription.\nComposition.\nThis painting was executed in oils and perhaps tempera on a small, walnut wood panel. It depicts a young man in bust length and three-quarter view, whose right hand holds a folded piece of sheet music. The painting is largely unfinished save for the face and hair, but is in good condition overall, with only the bottom right corner suffering damage. The art historian Kenneth Clark noted that out of Leonardo's surviving works, the \"Musician\" is perhaps the best preserved, despite the fading of colors over time.\nThe bottom of the work may have been slightly trimmed. There is a small amount of retouching, especially towards the back of the head; the art historian Frank Z\u00f6llner has noted that this retouching introduced the somewhat unsuccessful shading of the neck and the left side of the lips. With its black background, the portrait is reminiscent of Leonardo's later portraits, the \"Lady with an Ermine\" and \"La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\", but differs from them in that the sitter's body and head face the same direction. The biographer Walter Isaacson has noted that due to the work's unfinished state, the portrait's shadows are overtly harsh, and the portrait itself features fewer of the thin layers of oil paint typically found in Leonardo's paintings.\nThe musician.\nThe sitter has curly shoulder-length hair, wears a red cap, and stares intently at something outside the viewer's field of vision. His stare is intensified by careful lighting that focuses attention on his face, especially on his large glassy eyes. He wears a tight white undershirt. The painting of his black doublet is unfinished and his brownish-orange stole is only underpainted. The colors are faded, probably due to minor repainting and poor conservation. Technical examination of the work has revealed that the doublet was probably originally dark red, and the stole bright yellow.\nThe mouth hints at a smile, or suggests that the man is about to sing or has just sung. A notable feature of his face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light dilates the pupils of both eyes, but the proper right far more than the left, something that is not possible. Some have argued that this is simply for dramatic effect, so that the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face. The art historian Luke Syson has written that \"the eyes are perhaps the most striking feature of the \"Musician\", sight given primacy as the noblest sense and the most important tool of the painter\".\nSheet music.\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper, which is held in an odd and delicate manner, is a piece of sheet music with musical notes and letters written on it. Due to the poor condition of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible. This has not stopped some scholars from hypothesizing what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity. The partially erased letters can be made out as \"Cant\" and \"An\" and are usually read as \", Latin for 'angelic song', although the art historian Martin Kemp notes that it could be \", Italian for 'angelic singer'. The notes have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting that the subject is a musician. They are in mensural notation and therefore probably show polyphonic music. Leonardo's surviving drawings of rebuses with musical notation in the Print Room of Windsor Castle do not resemble the music in the painting. This suggests that this musical composition is not by Leonardo, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music unknown.\nAttribution.\nAlthough the attribution to Leonardo had been controversial in earlier centuries, modern art historians now regard the \"Portrait of a Musician\" as one of his original works. Doubts about ascribing the work to Leonardo have existed for almost as long as the painting has been known. Its first appearance in a 1672 catalog for the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana listed it as by Leonardo, but a 1686 inventory of the collection attributed it to Bernardino Luini. This was quickly crossed out and changed to \"or rather by Leonardo\". In 1798, the Ambrosiana attributed the portrait to the \"school of Luini\", but it was soon relisted as by Leonardo. When first listed in 1672, it was described as having \"all the elegance that might be expected of a ducal commission\", which implies that the subject was thought to be Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, who was Leonardo's employer when the painting was executed. This was accepted until the 20th century, when scholars believed it to be a pendant to the \"Portrait of a Lady\" in the Ambrosiana, now attributed to Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis but at the time thought to be a portrait by Leonardo of Beatrice d'Este, Ludovico's wife. In the mid-20th century, the Leonardo specialist Angela Ottino della Chiesa identified eleven scholars who supported an attribution to Leonardo; eight who ascribed the work to Ambrogio de Predis; two who were undecided and one who considered it the work of Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, another of Leonardo's students.\nThere is no extant record of the portrait's commission. Its attribution to Leonardo is based on stylistic and technical similarities to other works by him, notably the face of the angel in the Louvre \"Virgin of the Rocks\" and that of the titular figure in \"Saint Jerome in the Wilderness\". The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in later paintings by him, such as the \"Lady with an Ermine\", \"La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\" and \"Saint John the Baptist\". The \"Lady with an Ermine\" in particular has shown many stylistic similarities to the \"Musician\" from X-ray testing. Other characteristics typical of Leonardo's style include the melancholic atmosphere, the sensitive eyes, the ambiguous mouth (which seems to have just closed or is about to open), and curly hair reminiscent of his earlier portrait, \"Ginevra de' Benci\". Also characteristic of Leonardo is the use of walnut wood, a medium he favored and recommended, but which was not commonly used by other artists in Lombardy at the time. The attribution is further supported by a comparison of the pupils of the musician's eyes, which dilate to different degrees; a connection has been noted to the following passage in Leonardo's notebooks:\nChallenge to the painting's attribution stems from its rigid and stoic demeanor, which is uncharacteristic of Leonardo's usual paintings. While some scholars consider this a result of the painting's unfinished state, others have proposed that the clothing and torso were painted by a student. If Leonardo was assisted by another artist, the most frequently cited candidates are Boltraffio and Ambrogio de Predis, due to their style being closer to the hard and rigid qualities of the portrait. According to the art historian Carlo Pedretti, Boltraffio and Marco d'Oggiono, another student of Leonardo, depict eyes in the same way as the portrait, suggesting that either might have collaborated with Leonardo on the work. The art historian Pietro C. Marani noted that it is unlikely that Leonardo would have had assistants in the mid-1480s, and even if so, they would not likely have assisted on a portrait for an official or a personal friend. Despite Marani's claims, the modern scholarly consensus on whether Leonardo was assisted remains unclear: Z\u00f6llner stated that it is \"now accepted that Leonardo executed the face, while Boltraffio is credited with the entire upper body\", whereas according to Syson only a \"substantial minority\" of scholars disagreed with a full attribution. While there is debate on the authorship of the painting as a whole, most scholars are agreed that the face, at least, is entirely Leonardo's work.\nDating.\nArt historians place the work within Leonardo's first Milanese period (), due to similarities with other works from this time, including stylistic resemblances to the \"Lady with an Ermine\" found via X-ray testing, as well as the treatment of chiaroscuro in the Louvre \"Virgin of the Rocks\", and his sketches for a bronze horse sculpture. Older sources dated the work to the middle of this period, with dates of 1485\u20131490 and 1490 given.\nModern scholars, including Syson and Marani, have observed that Leonardo could not have executed the portrait much later than 1487, as it is considered to lack the refinement and realism of later works informed by his anatomical studies, such as the \"Lady with an Ermine\". It was not until 1489 that Leonardo engaged in a study of human anatomy, particularly that of the skull. Because of this, the painting is now thought to have been completed earlier in the period, during the mid-1480s, usually between 1483 and 1487.\nBackground.\nHistorical context.\nThe \"Portrait of a Musician\" is a radical departure from the prevailing form of portraiture in 15th-century Milan. The Milanese audience was more artistically conservative than others elsewhere in Italy, and would have expected most, if not all, portraits to be in profile, like those by Zanetto Bugatto, Vincenzo Foppa and Ambrogio Bergognone. The sitter's three-quarter profile was already common in Early Netherlandish painting, where portraits were often set against a flat black background. Antonello da Messina would introduce similar three-quarter-view portraits with black backgrounds in Venice and Sicily, with works like the \"Portrait of a Man\" () and the \"Portrait of a Man with a Red Hat\". Leonardo is likely to have been influenced by Antonello's style, and could have seen that artist's work during Antonello's brief visit to Milan in 1476, or in Venice around 1486, when Leonardo might have been in the city visiting his former teacher Andrea del Verrocchio. The art historian Daniel Arasse suggested that while the \"Portrait of a Musician\" is the most similar of Leonardo's portraits to Antonello's, the figure is facing away from the viewer, in contrast not only to most of Antonello's portraits, but also to Leonardo's other portraits. The \"Portrait of a Young Man\" () in the Pinacoteca di Brera by an artist in Leonardo's circle was heavily influenced by the \"Portrait of a Musician\".\nProvenance.\nThe \"Portrait of a Musician\" is Leonardo's only known male portrait painting and his only panel painting to remain in Milan. Marani noted that the work was likely meant for private use. It is generally thought not to have been among the works gifted to the Ambrosiana by its founder, Cardinal Federico Borromeo, in 1618, which at the time made up the bulk of the museum's collection. It is possible that it may have been given to the Ambrosiana in 1637 by , a noted collector of works by Leonardo such as \"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist\" and the Codex Atlanticus.\nThe work is first documented in 1672 when it was catalogued by Pietro Paolo Bosca in the Ambrosiana. Sources vary on whether Napoleon took the \"Portrait of a Musician\" to France in 1796. Marani stated that it was looted, but Syson stated that the French considered the Codex Atlanticus to be more valuable and took that instead. Both scholars agree that it was in the Ambrosiana in 1798.\nThe portrait was exhibited in the 2011\u20132012 exhibition \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\" at the National Gallery, London, the 2015 exhibition \"Leonardo 1452\u20131519: Il Disegno del Mondo\" at the Royal Palace of Milan, and the 2019\u20132020 exhibition \"L\u00e9onard de Vinci\" at the Louvre.\nIdentity of the sitter.\nThe identification of the sitter as Ludovico was accepted until a 1904\u20131905 restoration by Luigi Cavenaghi and Antonio Grandi removed a layer of overpaint and revealed a hand holding sheet music. This led scholars to believe that the subject was not Ludovico, but a musician in Milan at the same time as Leonardo. Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter; however, his identity remains uncertain. The man may have appeared in other works by Leonardo and his studio. Scholars at the National Gallery have suggested that Francesco Napoletano's \"Portrait of a Youth in Profile\" and Leonardo's drawing of a \"Bust of a Youth in Profile\" are of the same person. Various historical candidates have been proposed, but without firm evidence.\nFranchinus Gaffurius.\nThe architectural historian Luca Beltrami's proposition of Franchinus Gaffurius (1451\u20131522) became the leading candidate in the early 20th century. Gaffurius was a priest and a prominent music theorist in Milan, court musician for Ludovico Sforza, and of Milan Cathedral. He is sure to have been acquainted with Leonardo, since\u2014in addition to their shared employer\u2014Gaffurius's 1496 music treatise, , contains various woodcuts by Leonardo. Additionally, Beltrami proposed that the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" were abbreviated from the Latin and a reference to , another music treatise by Gaffurius.\nDoubt has been cast upon this theory since the iconographic evidence does not match Gaffurius to the sitter. Kemp has noted that the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" could just as easily stand for , Italian for 'angelic singer'. The subject of the painting was not depicted in a clerical robe, which would have properly identified him as a priest, and the subject of the painting is a young man, whereas Gaffurius would have been in his early thirties at the time of the painting's creation.\nAtalante Migliorotti.\nMarani's 1999 treatise suggests the Tuscan musician Atalante Migliorotti (1466\u20131532), and since then many commentators have supported the theory. In 1482, Migliorotti and Leonardo left Florence for the court of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. They were known to be friends and Leonardo is believed to have taught Migliorotti the lute. During the painting's conception, Migliorotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a plausible candidate. Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the Codex Atlanticus, Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised\". This is thought to have been a study for, or an earlier version of, the \"Portrait of a Musician\". The intimate nature of the present portrait makes it especially likely that the subject was a personal friend.\nThe main argument against this theory is that the subject's face is not raised as described in the 1482 note. However, Marani noted that while the musician's face is not raised in a literal sense, \"the expression seems uplifted, suggesting a singer who has just raised his face from the sheet of music\". Since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliorotti is now favored by many commentators.\nJosquin des Prez.\nIn 1972 the Belgian musicologist proposed the French singer and composer Josquin des Prez ( \u2013 1521) as the sitter. Josquin worked in the service of the Sforza family during the 1480s, concurrently with Leonardo. Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the sheet music are \"Cont\" (an abbreviation of \"Contratenor\"), \"Cantuz\" (Cantus), and \"A Z\" (an abbreviation of \"Altuz\"), and that this meant that they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as masses, motets and songs by Josquin. This theory has since been discredited; the notation is largely illegible and many composers were writing in this manner. As with Gaffurius, other portraits of Josquin do not show a resemblance to the sitter and, as a priest in his mid-thirties, he was unlikely to have been the painting's subject.\nGaspar van Weerbeke.\nThe art historian Laure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter is Gaspar van Weerbeke (), a Netherlandish composer and singer. Weerbeke worked for the Sforza family at the same time as Leonardo, and so they likely knew each other. This theory cites letters from Galeazzo Maria Sforza to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Weerbeke, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our singers\". As Fagnart pointed out, the letter is too vaguely stated to definitely link Weerbeke to the portrait. Additionally, Weerbeke presents the same issue as Josquin and Gaffurius; Weerbeke would have been in his thirties and probably too old to be the sitter.\nOthers.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the subject of the portrait was identified by as Galeazzo Sanseverino, Ludovico's son-in-law and captain general of the Sforza militias, a prominent figure of the Milanese court. In support of this thesis, the Italian scholar Piero Misciatelli recalls that Galeazzo had been a patron of Leonardo and was probably passionate about music. Other scholars, such as the French art historian , have recognized the traits of his father, Roberto Sanseverino.\nGian Galeazzo Sforza (1469\u20131494) has been proposed, given that the original, vague, description of the portrait stated that it depicted the Duke of Milan. Syson has noted that this identification would be particularly meaningful, as Gian Galeazzo was the rightful heir to the throne before Ludovico took power. However, there is no direct evidence to support this, and the uncovering of the sheet music makes this very unlikely as Gian Galeazzo is not known to have been a musician.\nFrancesco Canova da Milano (1497\u20131543), an Italian lutenist and composer, and the Flemish singer Giovanni Cordier have been proposed, albeit without substantive evidence. The Dutch illustrator Siegfried Woldhek has suggested that the \"Portrait of a Musician\" is one of three self-portraits by Leonardo.\nCritical opinion.\nThe critical opinion of the \"Portrait of a Musician\" has historically been mixed, and negative reactions have given some scholars reluctance to grant it a full attribution to Leonardo. The 19th-century art historian Eug\u00e8ne M\u00fcntz complemented its \"vigor of modeling worthy of Rembrandt\", but criticized the work for a sullen expression, poor coloring and incompleteness. According to Marani, these comments can largely be explained by M\u00fcntz's use of a very poor reproduction for analysis. Like M\u00fcntz, Z\u00f6llner found fault with the work's incompleteness and expression; he also considered its pose inferior to that of \"Ginevra de' Benci\". The art historian Jack Wasserman has stated that the portrait lacks the typical facial intensity of Leonardo's other works; however, Syson and Kemp have praised the sitter's intense stare, and the art historian Alessandro Vezzosi stated that in this work \"Leonardo attains an unprecedented level of psychological intensity, which reaches the sublime in \"Lady with an Ermine\"\". The chiaroscuro has been a point of contention: Z\u00f6llner and other scholars have criticized it as \"over-emphatic\"; Syson considered it dramatic and compelling; whereas Isaacson has criticized the shadowing but praised the lighting of the eyes. Syson has suggested that the work's unfinished state largely accounts for these negative reactions.\nInterpretation.\nDue to a paucity of contemporary records, some scholars have proposed theories as to the purpose of the painting. Some believe that the tension in the subject's face is intense because he has just finished or is in the process of performing. Other scholars see the painting as a representation of Leonardo's self-proclaimed ideology of the superiority of painting over other art forms such as poetry, sculpture and music. Leonardo declared at the beginning of his incomplete \"Treatise on Painting\":\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music's ephemeral nature, in contrast to painting's material and permanent physical qualities. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to the idea that music simply disappears after a performance. Another interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the man's beauty. More likely, given the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was made as a personal gift for a close friend."

Keatinge Johnson later commanded the Australian Overseas base in Egypt, was Assistant Adjutant-General in England and in the final stage of his military career was cable censor at the British Military Intelligence Department.\nFamily.\nClarence Arnold Keatinge Johnson was born in England in 1870 and educated at Bedford Modern School.\nIn 1902 he married an Australian, Marjorie (n\u00e9e Brodribb), at St George's Hanover Square Church, London. According to his obituary in \"The Times\", he was a sportsman who enjoyed big game hunting in the Himalayas and also a keen fisherman who caught big game fish in New Zealand and Queensland. Keatinge Johnson died in London in 1937. He was survived by his widow, a son and a daughter.\nMilitary career.\nIn 1889 Keatinge Johnson was commissioned into the Royal Welsh Fusiliers at Lucknow and saw service with them in the Black Mountain Expedition of 1891. In August 1892 he left the Welsh Fusiliers to join the 1st Bengal Lancers (Skinner's Horse) and served in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Having been promoted Major in 1907, he was forced to retire in 1912 on the grounds of ill health and moved to Australia with his Australian wife.\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Keatinge Johnson offered his service to the Commonwealth Government and was made second in command of the 4th Light Horse, AIF, which was part of the contingent in the 1st Expeditionary Force to Egypt.

He was subsequently sent back to England having been invalided and suffering from dysentery. It was not long before he was back in Egypt as Assistant Commandant at Tel-el-Kebir before returning to England as Assistant Adjutant-General in 1916. He was made Commander of the A Group Training Brigade on Salisbury Plain before resigning from the AIF in 1917 with the permanent rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. For the remainder of the War he was at the Military Intelligence Department as cable censor."

        "text": "The North Wales Society of Architects (NWSA; ; formerly the \"North Wales Architectural Society\") is one of four branches of the Royal Society of Architects in Wales (RSAW). It was established in 1928 as an independent organisation, becoming a branch of the newly formed Society of Architects in Wales (as the RSAW was initially styled) in 1970 upon the restructuring of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).\nThe Society champions better buildings, communities and the environment through architecture and its members. As of 2014 it represented over 120 chartered architects in the region.\nThe RSAW is the Wales region of the RIBA. RSAW was granted Royal status by the Privy Council in 1994. The society are also members of the Architects Benevolent Society and provide advice for members in the North Wales area.\nEvents &amp; publications.\nThe Society is noted as being a particularly active branch of the RIBA and organises an annual series of well-attended building visits and lectures, usually held from early autumn through to late spring. In line with NWSA's ethos of promoting architecture to a wider audience, these events are open to non-members and all with an interest in design and architecture.\nVisits have included the 2014 Stirling Prize-winning Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, Copper Kingdom, Amlwch, recipient of the RSAW Building of the Year 2014 and Cefn Castell, Criccieth, RSAW Small Project of the Year, 2015.\nThe society has previously jointly produced the journal, Architecture Wales, with their South Wales counterpart, and as the Chester &amp; North Wales Architectural Society.\nGovernance.\nThe Society is governed by its elected Council. Councillors are elected for a three-year term at the Society's Annual General Meetings and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. Council meets every two months and is led by the Society's President, who serves a maximum two-year term. There is no maximum term for the Society's Honorary Secretary and Honorary Treasurer offices.\nDesign Consultation.\nNWSA offers a design review panel to provide impartial expert advice on the quality of designs submitted to local authority Planning Departments across North Wales.\nRegalia.\nThe Society's Presidential Chain of Office was designed in 1954 by Fattorini and Sons of Birmingham of hallmarked sterling silver finished in polished hard gold plate and vitreous enamelled in three colours. Between 1961 and 1994 the Society presented a Past President Medal, similarly designed and produced by Fattorini. This custom was reinstated in 2017.\nPresidents.\nAs of February 2024, the Society has been served by 46 presidents in its 96-year history, amongst them many celebrated luminaries of the profession.\nWhilst there are inconsistencies in the years in office quoted below, due to Annual General Meetings being held at various times throughout the year, with the exception of the Second World War Presidents have served a single fixed two-year term.\nCurrent President David G Hughes is the first two-time holder of the office.\nFor consistency and in the interests of historical accuracy, the dates shown are therefore taken directly from the Chain of Office.\nHonorary Secretaries.\n\"This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.\"\nHonorary Treasurers.\n\"This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.\""

        "text": "The Paradise Ground was a football ground in Middlesbrough in England. It was the home ground of Middlesbrough Ironopolis.\nHistory.\nThe Paradise Ground was initially a field behind Oldgate Farm to the south-west of Middlesbrough town centre. When Middlesbrough Ironopolis began using the ground in 1889, there were no spectator facilities. However, later developments included small covered stands being built on three sides of the pitch and some uncovered seating. However, players and officials had to change at the County Hotel, which was far enough away to require transport to be provided to reach the ground.\nThe ground's record attendance of 14,000 was set on 18 February 1893 for an FA Cup match against Preston North End. Later in the year Ironopolis were elected to the Second Division of the Football League, and the first Football League game was played at the Paradise Ground on 2 September 1893, with Ironopolis losing 2\u20130 to Liverpool in front of 2,000 spectators. However, attendances began to drop rapidly, with only around 200 watching the 25 November match against Small Heath, well below the official lowest Football League attendance of 469 set by Thames in 1930. Ironopolis resigned from the league at the end of the season and subsequently folded. The last Football League game at the ground was played on 3 March 1894, with Ironopolis beating Northwich Victoria 2\u20131 in front of 2,000 spectators.\nThe north-west corner of the site was used to build Middlesbrough F.C.'s Ayresome Park ground in the early 1900s, whilst the rest of the site was used for housing."

        "title": "Talisman (Alpha Flight)",
        "text": "Talisman (Elizabeth Twoyoungmen) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\nPublication history.\nShe first appeared as Elizabeth Twoyoungmen in \"Alpha Flight\" #5 (December 1983). The character was created by John Byrne.\nFictional character biography.\nElizabeth Twoyoungmen was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the daughter of Michael Twoyoungmen (who would later be the superhero Shaman of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight) and his wife Kathryn. Elizabeth became estranged from her father at the age of four after the death of her mother following an illness. Michael, a physician, had promised Elizabeth he would save Kathryn, and his failure led Elizabeth to be bitter and resentful toward him.\nAs a college archaeology student, Elizabeth was excavating the site of the original Fort Calgary when she discovered a skull. When she touched it, an apparition appeared that only she could see. Frightened, she sought out her father, whom she recognized as Shaman despite a spell he had cast to prevent himself from being so recognized. Together they investigated the skull, determining that it was the source of ancient anger or ancient evil.\nMeanwhile, a young woman named Emily Stang was tending to her great-grandfather, Lucas Stang, when she was attacked by a mystical force manifesting itself through scrambled eggs (eggs being both a symbol of new life and a symbol of potential life unfulfilled). Shaman and Elizabeth traveled to the site of the manifestation, and Shaman seemingly defeated it. However, the force again manifested itself, this time through Lucas, and possessed Emily. As the possessed Emily attacked Elizabeth, Shaman identified it as Ranaq the Devourer, one of the Great Beasts of the North. Under Ranaq's barrage, Elizabeth found herself growing stronger until she was able instinctively to turn the force of Ranaq's attack back against it. Shaman launched an attack on Ranaq as well, and together they drove the beast out of Emily, saving her life. Shortly thereafter, Elizabeth reached into Shaman's mystical medicine pouch at his bidding and withdrew a coronet (later identified as the \"Coronet of Enchantment\"). Placing it on her brow, she was transformed into Talisman, with the power to manipulate vast magical energies and command the spirits of nature to do her will. She then became a member of Alpha Flight. She was horrified to later learn that she was unable to remove the coronet without enduring unbearable, agonizing pain.\nAlongside Alpha Flight, she later fought the rest of the Great Beasts. She was captured by the original Omega Flight and became trapped in the void within Shaman's mystic pouch. She was rescued by the Beyonder and subsequently quit Alpha Flight. Her natural arrogance magnified by her newfound powers as well as the Coronet of Enchantment's influence, and with her bitterness toward her father rekindled \u2014 both by his failure to tell her about the coronet and his failure to save her from being consumed by the Void within his medicine pouch \u2014 Talisman became corrupted by her powers. She took the impending birth of fellow Alphan Snowbird's first child as her opportunity for revenge on him. She commanded the spirits to lead Shaman to a place of power required for the birth that was also a place of death, intending to let the malevolent spirit trapped there to defeat her father before saving the day herself. However, the spirit trapped there had never truly died, and so was beyond her power to bind. Possessing Snowbird's baby and calling himself Pestilence, the malevolent entity attacked Alpha Flight and tore the coronet from Talisman's brow, thus restoring Elizabeth's humanity. However, in the continuing battle, Shaman donned the coronet, claiming the name and powers of Talisman, and forced Pestilence to flee.\nSeveral months later, Elizabeth was sent a dream by Snowbird about the Dreamqueen. Elizabeth learned that she still had her powers. She regained the coronet from Shaman and her power as Talisman, and she aided Alpha Flight during a confrontation with the Dreamqueen. She then fought Llan the Sorcerer. With Alpha Flight, she fought the illusory \"super heroes\" on the Dreamqueen's world. She exorcised a demon serving Llan from a child. She brought together Aurora, Purple Girl, Laura Dean, and Goblyn to find Northstar. Talisman's spirit traveled back in time to learn about her incarnation as Nahita of the Tribe of the Moon, and her first defeat of Llan. She defeated Llan with the aid of Doctor Strange and Alpha and Gamma Flights. Some time later, Elizabeth was attacked and injured by the second Omega Flight, and she was forced to release the Ska'r. She directed Gamma Flight in defeating the Ska'r, and she joined the new Beta Flight.\nOmega Flight.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War of American superheroes, some of their enemies fled north to Canada. To combat this threat, Sasquatch began recruiting for a new team to protect the borders. While initially refusing to join this new Omega Flight, Talisman is spurred into action by Sasquatch's capture, returning to Ottawa to meet with the rest of the team. After angrily accusing Iron Man of bringing the supervillain crisis about through the bitter conflict of the Superhuman Civil War, Elizabeth is horrified to learn that Michael Pointer, the man who killed Alpha Flight, has been selected as the new Guardian. Angry that a murderer and an American is wearing a Canada-inspired costume, Talisman refuses to have anything to do with the former thrall of the Collective. She leaves him behind as the rest of the team goes to Toronto to fight the Wrecking Crew. Aiding the team in their battle against the Great Beasts-empowered Crew and their Surtur demon allies, Elizabeth hesitates when confronted by a Tanaraq-possessed Sasquatch, but she is saved by Guardian's timely arrival. Finally seeing that he was truly remorseful for the indirect role he played in the destruction of Alpha Flight and his outright refusal to kill Sasquatch when he was possessed, Elizabeth finally forgives Pointer. During the series, Talisman is shown wearing Shaman's medicine bag, which she likely inherited after her father's death at the hands of the Collective.\nShe re-appeared in \"She-Hulk\" (vol. 2) #16 (2007) when she tried to bypass a S.H.I.E.L.D. unit, as she had a cure that could end an attacking Wendigo's rampage. However due to security delays, and before Talisman could do anything, the She-Hulk and Wolverine had already defeated him.\nSome time later, Elizabeth and her longtime teammate and mentor, Puck, became lovers.\nPowers and abilities.\nTalisman possesses vast supernatural powers as a result of her descent from forty generations of Sarcee shamans, and was once described as \"a mortal channel through which the gods can fight\", as well as \"a director of forces, not a combatant\". Her father, Shaman, has stated that her powers when properly developed would rival even that of the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange. Primary among her powers is the ability to command the Spirits of the Land to do her bidding, meaning she is literally part of the Spirit World itself. While Shaman could only implore the Spirits for help, Talisman can command them outright. She has the ability to tap into mystical forces and to manipulate them for a variety of effects, including levitation, astral projection, exorcism, matter manipulation, the ability to see prophetic visions, telepathy, teleportation over vast distances, opening inter-dimensional portals, animating the undead, generating wind blasts and lightning, summoning air spirits, calling forth spirit animals, creating magical shields of light, and generating blasts of magical energy. She also has the ability to perceive various mystical phenomena. She possesses considerable knowledge of the mystic arts of the Sarcee.\nMost of Talisman's powers stem from the ancient Coronet of Enchantment, which she wears on her forehead. However, even without the Coronet, she has shown to possess the ability to absorb and redirect magical energy used against her, but the Coronet greatly amplifies her powers. Talisman cannot remove the Coronet without it causing her severe mental pain (and it took a great effort from others to remove it). However, if someone else wears it, returning the Coronet to the true owner would spare them the pain. When out of costume, Talisman can use an illusion to hide the presence of the Coronet. Talisman stated in \"Omega Flight #5\" that she \"no longer has the blessings she once had\", making her level of power unclear.\nFollowing the death of her father, Talisman possesses also Shaman's medicine bag, which contains a pocket dimension known as the Void. She can summon all manner of mystical objects and potions from the bag.\nOther characters named Talisman.\nNahita / Talisman was a previous wearer of the Coronet of Enchantment and a member of the Tribe of the Moon.\nAfter Elizabeth Twoyoungmen was initially corrupted by her power, Shaman temporarily seized the Coronet of Enchantment, assuming the name and powers of Talisman.\nIn the mini-series Contest of Champions, where the Grandmaster and Death use the heroes of earth for a contest, a character named Talisman was from Australia, a member of an Aboriginal tribe, who used a mystic \"bullroarer\" to create various mystical effects, such as disorientate opponents."

In 2002, TEVA and Mistral Films won the grand prize at IMAGINA for an experimental short film, \"The Tale of the Floating World\" directed by Alain Escalle, beating such prestigious competition as \"Shrek\", \"Am\u00e9lie\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", and was entirely responsible for the fabrication of Storimages\u2019 Pulcinella-winning and International Emmy-nominated special, \"Marcelin Caillou\", based on the book by famous French illustrator Jean-Jacques Semp\u00e9. In 2006, \"The Triplets of Belleville\", \"The Dog, the General and the Pigeons\" and \"Blackmor\u2019s Treasure\" were part of an eight-film retrospective of contemporary French animation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York called \"Grand Illusions: The Best of Recent French Animation.\"\nMr. Panzner has written original animated television shows, adapted into English a number of other television shows and feature films and writes regularly for Animation World Network, Animation Magazine, ASIFA, Stylus Magazine, Arts Editor, Artnow Online, etc. As of 2022, he has written 55 original episodes of television animated series including Pulcinella-winning and International Emmy-nominated series (31 episodes + 2 specials) \"Angelo Rules!\" (TeamTo), \"Taking Down Taffy!\" (Cybergroup), \"Pat the Dog\" and \"The New Adventures of Geronimo Stilton\" (Superprod), \"Angry Birds\" (Rovio), \"The Popples\" (Method Films), \"Babar and the Adventures of Badou\" (Nelvana), etc.\nIn 2005, he developed a series (5 X 52') of high-definition television documentaries on communication with animals, \"Talk to Me\", and two one-hour specials, \"The Hermione and Lafayette\", about the reconstruction of the ship the Marquis de Lafayette sailed to America on during the American Revolutionary War for Woods TV, Paris. He also did the English adaptation of Michel Fessler's, author of Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature \"March of the Penguins\", latest feature film in development Henri Bosco's \"L'Enfant et la Rivi\u00e8re\".\nIn 2006, Mr. Panzner was Director, Short Form Programming for Discovery Communications and was responsible for the development and production of math (80 X 10\u2019) and social studies (100 X 5\u2019) shorts for Discovery Education's \"www.unitedstreaming.com\". As part of his responsibilities, he also did development of short form programming for the diverse Discovery networks and new media platforms.\nSince leaving Discovery, Mr. Panzner has dedicated his time to the development of a new audiovisual industry he has invented, \"Re:Naissance\" is a revolutionary new concept in animation, conceived as a means of transforming aging catalog and archives into salable, low-cost, high quality audiovisual products. For the first time ever in the 100-year history of animation, Re:Naissance is going to invert the adaptation process by taking existing live-action films and faithfully reproducing them in animation, in a totally original graphic style unique to every film. As astonishing as it might sound, this has never been done. The first Re:Naissance film is George A. Romero's 1968 cult horror classic \"Night of the Living Dead\".\nIn the Spring of 2010 (March 12-April 17), he also had his first one-man show of drawings/collages in Paris, \"D\u00e9collage\", at Etains du Campanile (95 rue de Seine.)\nAs an illustrator, a work of his was included in \"The Graphic Canon: The Definitive Anthology of the World's Great Literature as Comics and Visuals\" from an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", exclusively in images, \"What is the Use of a Book Without Pictures\". One of his works was also included in a special traveling exhibition of \"Guard Dog: Global Jam\" (2011), a shot-by-shot remake of Bill Plympton\u2019s Oscar-nominated short \"Guard Dog (film)\" where each sequence was assigned to \"a willing volunteer who would reanimate it in any chosen style or medium.\" Described as \"a flicker frame extravaganza where every individual frame was outsourced to a different artist to interpret in their own way,\" the sequence the still is from a collaboration within a collaboration, the same people who spearheaded the similar mass collaboration project \"Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated.\" \"Guard Dog: Global Jam\" won the award for Best Experimental Animation at ASIFA-EAST 2011.\nMr. Panzner created New Art and Culture magazine LHOOQ in 2011, a vanity project, featuring Michael Holman (\"Subculturist Michael Holman: Historical Revisionism and the Politically Correct in Hip Hop/Downtown.\") LHOOQ magazine is part of Michael Holman's archive bought by the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, the first Hip Hop collection in its holdings. In 2018, an article appeared describing Panzner's friendship with Jean-Michel Basquiat and Matt Dike (and the curious link between those two) at Phillips Auction House, \"Got the Time: Matt Dike &amp; Jean\u2010Michel Basquiat\" by Peter Relic.\nHe is currently a freelance writer and illustrator and recently completed his first solo illustration project (2015), a mash-up of French illustrator Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s collected works for Friedrich Nietzsche's masterpiece \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\". The 103 illustrations ink drawings, done to resemble engravings, correspond to the approximately 90 chapters of the work (as well as title page, frontispiece, chapters, etc.) Twelve illustrations appeared in \"Evergreen Review\" in an article by Robert Guffey called \"Donald Trump's Operation Mindfuck\" (Election Day, 2020).\nA series of fifty-five watercolor and ink Illustrations commemorating Jack Kerouac\u2019s Beat Generation classic called \"The Illustrated \"On the Road\"\", has been approved by the Jack Kerouac Estate and is on permanent loan to their website. The series debuted on Kerouac's ninety-eighth birthday on March 12, 2020, fifty years after his passing (October 21, 1969.) The \"Evergreen Review\" featured ten of these illustrations from The Illustrated \"On the Road\", celebrating Jack Kerouac's Centenniel on March 12, 2022."

        "text": "The South Carolina Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (SCFCWC) was an African American women's club founded in 1909 in South Carolina. The umbrella organization was created by Marion Birnie Wilkinson, Sara B. Henderson, Lizella A. Jenkins Moorer, Celia Dial Saxon and other women who met at Sydney Park Church in Columbia. They adopted the motto of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC), \"Lifting as We Climb.\" Wilkinson became the first president and worked towards improving education and living conditions for black people in South Carolina. The organization grew to have twenty-five hundred members in 1922. One of the major accomplishments of the SCFCWC was the creation of the Wilkinson Home for Colored Girls in Cayce. The home was originally for girls who had been deemed \"delinquent\" and later housed orphans.\nThe SCFCWC from the beginning aimed to improve education, hold an educational convention annually, protect women and children in the home and at work, further political security and rights, and promote interracial understanding. Black women at the time understood the importance of forming ties with white women in their fight for equality. The white women active in SCFCWC often were committed to improving African American lives, but they still upheld racial norms.\nDuring the 1940s, black women in South Carolina used the SCFCWC to further their goals of equal pay for teachers, voting rights, full citizenship, and support for middle-class black women. The SCFCWC worked to include African Americans in the political process. \nSCFCWC also raised money for other organizations and causes and ran food drives. The organization became a United Way agency in 1960."

        "title": "Protests against the Trump administration family separation policy",
        "text": "Protests against the Trump administration family separation policy are a reaction to the Trump administration policy of separating children from their parents or guardians who crossed the U.S. border either illegally or to request asylum, jailing the adults and locating the minors at separate facilities under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nBackground.\nThe Trump Administration started a \"zero tolerance\" policy on May 7, 2018, under which any person crossing the United States border may be charged with a federal misdemeanor. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that policy. During remarks made on May 7 in Scottsdale, Arizona, he said, \"If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law.\" However, immigration rights activists have reported that children accompanying adults have been verified to be members of families, not part of a child trafficking scheme as suggested by Sessions. \nBecause minors cannot be jailed under a 2016 ruling by C.D. Cal. Judge Dolly M. Gee regarding the 1997 \"Reno v. Flores\" settlement, they are separated from their families. Minors are housed in detention centers that can be made up of tents or other makeshift facilities. Illegal border crossing is a crime in the United States. However, migrants attempting to apply for asylum in the United States are also being denied entry. In addition, immigration activists allege that parents are not being reunited with their children after their parents' sentences in detention are finished. Sessions also announced that the United States would no longer accept asylum applications for migrants who are victims of domestic abuse or gang violence. \nFundraising.\nInspired by the viral photo of a crying two-year-old girl looking up at her mother, on June 16, 2018, a California couple started a fund-raising campaign on Facebook named \"Reunite an immigrant parent with their child\" with a goal of raising $1,500 (~$ in ). As of June 20, more than $17 million had been raised. The money will go to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, and provide legal aid for immigrant parents who have been arrested at the border.\nThe photograph was taken by professional photographer John Moore just after the mother was asked to set her child down to be body-searched before boarding the Border Patrol van and as the little girl began to cry. The mother is from Honduras and had been traveling for a month.\nThe photograph has raised controversy after the father of the child said in an interview that the mother and daughter were now being detained together in McAllen, Texas. This has caused many in Trump's administration to rally against \"fake news;\" White House Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tweeted that the Democrats and media \"exploited this photo of a little girl to push their own agenda.\"\nA Portland, Oregon filmmaker, Linda Freeman, produced the video \"Unaccompanied: Alone in America\"\",\" in which children re-enact court transcripts of proceedings in which migrant children who have to represent themselves in immigration trials. While this policy of children being unrepresented in court can be seen in 2005, the video is part of a fundraiser to provide legal counsel, services, and efforts to reunify children with their families.\nIn response to the family separation policy many celebrities, such as Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend, donated to the ACLU in response to the \"...cruel, anti-family...\" actions, that \"...go against everything we believe this country should represent. Others, such as Jimmy Fallon, have also donated to the Texas-based charity Refugee and Immigration Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), at times in Trump's name, to protest the actions and policies of the Trump Administration.\nProtests.\nDuring a Congressional hearing on May 8, 2018, a group of mothers and their children held a silent protest in opposition to the zero-tolerance policy. Protests took place on May 31, 2018, in El Paso, Texas. Around 100 protestors in front of the El Paso County Courthouse held an \"Evening of Action\" rally. In San Antonio, around 300 people attended a #WhereAreTheChildren rally in Guadalupe Plaza. Joaquin Castro spoke at the demonstration. Some protesters compared the detainment of children by the U.S. government to the Nazi concentration camps.\nOn June 1, \"pop up protests\" were planned in around sixteen states on a national day of action. Hundreds protested the new policy, in Atlanta, New York City, Santa Monica, and Washington, D.C., on June 1. In Houston, protestors gathered outside the City Hall to demonstrate. In Concord, demonstrators gathered in front of the federal building. There were around fifty people protesting outside the federal building in San Diego. The protest in Memphis was organized in part by an attorney, Starkey Hahn. A protest took place in Austin at Republic Square Park in the afternoon. More than 100 people demonstrated outside the Immigration Services federal building in Los Angeles. Around 100 people demonstrated outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Philadelphia. In York County, Pennsylvania, people demonstrated outside the York County Detention Center on June 2, 2018.\nOn June 13, 2018, eight House Democrats blocked streets to protest the family separation policy. The protest started on the steps of the US Customs and Border Protection Building in Washington, D.C. Luis Gutierrez, Joe Crowley, John Lewis, Pramila Jayapal, Jan Schakowsky, Al Green, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Judy Chu, Adriano Espaillat, and Jimmy Gomez were joined by hundreds of activists and actor John Cusack.\nSome of the marches and protests were put together very quickly. The June 17, 2018, march in Tornillo, Texas was planned in around two days. Democratic politicians in Texas, including Beto O'Rourke and Veronica Escobar, organized the march with a group called the Latino Victory Project. Joe Kennedy III, Veronica Escobar, Lupe Valdez, Mary Gonz\u00e1lez, C\u00e9sar Blanco, Lina Ortega, and Gina Ortiz-Jones were also in attendance. The march was protesting a detention center for children near the port of entry in Tornillo. By June 16, 200 minors had been housed at the center, which is made up of tents in an area that experiences extreme heat in the summer. The march began at the Tornillo-Guadalupe Toll Plaza and extended to the area containing the \"tent city.\" Also on June 17, 2018, hundreds of protesters gathered outside an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. A vigil with around 200 people was held in McAllen, Texas, on June 17. Seattle also had a protest, which was held at Westlake Park. Representative Jayapal addressed the group.\nA planned \"Rally for Migrants\" was scheduled to take place in Phoenix, Arizona. On June 18, dozens of protesters showed up to demonstrate outside the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans while Attorney General Jeff Sessions was speaking. Also on June 18, 2018, nearly 100 protesters took part in a New York City rally organized by the Asian American Federation of New York, calling attention to the arrest of Xiu Qing You by ICE during a green card interview.\nProtesters demonstrated at LaGuardia Airport on the evening of June 20. There were around 200 protestors there to see unaccompanied immigrant minors being taken to New York. \nRise and Resist.\nOn July 4, 2018, a female member of the group Rise and Resist, Therese Patricia Okoumou, climbed the base of the Statue of Liberty to protest the separation of migrant families, and stayed there for nearly three hours. Tourists were evacuated from Liberty Island while New York City Police Officers responded to the scene, climbing 100 ft (30 m) to reach her. Okoumou was charged with trespassing, interference with government agency functions, and disorderly conduct in a Manhattan Court on July 5. US Attorney Geoffrey Berman released a statement that Okoumou \"staged a dangerous stunt that alarmed the public and endangered her own life and the lives of the NYPD officers who responded...\".\nHer actions were separate from an earlier protest by Rise and Resist that same day in which protesters unveiled an \"Abolish ICE\" banner on the statue's pedestal; seven members of the organization were arrested.\nFamilies Belong Together.\nA series of protests called \"Families Belong Together\" was organized by a group of political organizations. Protests took place on several dates in June in numerous cities, including Washington, D.C., Boston, Fort Wayne, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Cleveland, and St. Louis. In Los Angeles, there were hundreds of protestors who marched from MacArthur Park to an immigrant detention center downtown. There were also dozens of protestors in Huntington Village, New York. In Austin, hundreds of protestors rallied at the Texas State Capitol. In Eugene, Oregon, at a protest held in Kesey Square, more than 100 people attended. Akron, Ohio had 200 protesters.\nOn June 23, 2018, a rally in San Francisco drew more than 500 people. The event was one of a series of preliminary protests before the nationally organized Families Belong Together protests in Washington, D.C., New York City, and 700 other cities and towns in the United States. \nWomen Disobey.\nOn June 28, 2018, a protest in Washington, D.C., was organized by Women's March. According to organizers, \"2,500 women from 47 states participated in the protest.\" Protesters blocked streets around the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building as they demanded, \"abolish ICE,\" the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. The protest concluded at the Hart Senate Office Building, where 575 people were arrested following acts of mass civil disobedience. The arrested included Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington and actress Susan Sarandon."

        "text": "Hudson College is a co-educational, non-denominational private school for students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12. It is situated on a 4.5-acre campus in the former Earlscourt Junior Public School in central Toronto, Ontario.\nHistory.\nHudson College was established in early 2003. One of the school's founders, Jack Bavington, serves as the Upper School Director. Prior to his current role, Jack worked as a principal at a large collegiate institute in Scarborough. His son, Jeff Bavington, and also a school founder, is the Lower School Director. Rose Bastien serves as the Lower School Principal.\nThe school is housed in the former Earlscourt Junior Public School and leased from the Toronto District School Board, which also leases part of the building to the Toronto Catholic District School Board for Stella Maris Catholic School.\nPrograms.\nHudson College is a fully accredited school recognized by the Ontario Ministry of Education and a member of the Ontario Reggio Association. The education curriculum offers courses from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12, pre-university programs.\nLower School.\nAt the Lower School level (Junior Kindergarten through Grade 8), students are engaged in a rigorous academic program with Saxon Math, Language Arts, Science and other subjects over a recurring eight-day schedule. The Junior and Senior Kindergarten full-day programs are inspired by the methodologies of the Reggio Emilia teaching philosophy. This pedagogy encourages children to explore, investigate and grow. The Reggio Emilia approach to teaching originated in Northern Italy and is founded on the belief that children's curiosity about their world, as well as their innate sense of creativity, should guide their learning.\nLower School students may participate in many different extra-curricular clubs and activities throughout the course of a school year. Students from JK to Grade 4 participate in two co-curricular programs within the school year: an instructional skating program, followed by an instructional swimming program. Students receive level certifications through the official CanSkate and Ultra Swim accreditation programs. There are also camp trips to the Muskoka area, end-of-year visits to Quebec City and Ottawa, and other field trips during the course of the year such as a ski trip to Blue Mountain.\nThe Middle School Preparatory Program (Grades 6\u20138) teaches students executive functioning skills such as time management, organization and study habits, as well as critical thinking and test-taking skills to prepare students for entry to High School.\nUpper School.\nAt the Upper School level (Grades 9 through 12), Hudson College uses the standard Ontario curriculum to prepare students for university placement. They will receive the Ontario Secondary School Diploma upon completing their full range of school credits.\nStudents follow a flexible three-semester curriculum starting in Grade 9. The Fall semester begins in September and ends in December, where students enroll in up to four courses. The Winter semester begins during January and ends within April, where students again may enroll in up to four courses. The Spring semester takes place between May and June, where students may enroll in up to two courses.\nBeginning in Grade 8, all students and staff are part of a House System, with each House representing a major geographical area of Canada. The Houses include The Maritimes (Crimson Red), The Great Lakes (Royal Blue), The Prairies (Kelly Green), and The Rockies (Purple). Each House competes for the year-end awarding of the Discovery Trophy.\nThe Upper School offers a variety of clubs and activities as well as excursions within the province and internationally.\nUpper School students may also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh program.\nAthletics.\nSporting amenities at Hudson College include a modern gymnasium and outdoor recreational facilities, with a multi-sport turf field and running track. The school's sports teams are known as the Hudson Huskies.\nHudson College is part of the Small Schools Athletic Federation (SSAF). The SSAF calendar is divided into three athletic sessions \u2013 Fall, Winter, and Spring \u2013 with opportunities in either individual and/or team sports in each session. Hudson has won 16 banners in various SSAF sports. The school participates in 18 individual and team sports each year.\nHudson's uniform colours are navy blue, royal blue, and gold."

It is located at Ordnance Survey .\nAlbaston is about from the centre of Gunnislake and half-a-mile (0.7 kilometres) from Gunnislake railway station, the terminus of the Tamar Valley Line from Plymouth.\nHistory.\nHistorically, Albaston was closely connected with the nearby mine at Drakewalls. The success of the Drakewalls mine in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century led to the growth of the village of Albaston, including the construction of a Methodist chapel and several shops, dwellings and businesses. A brewery, Edward Bowhay &amp; Brothers, was established by 1877; this brewery had ceased operation by 1930.\nAlbaston, Chapel of Rest.\nThe grave yard in front was consecrated in 1888. Outside the chapel, just inside the main gate, there is a large Granite Memorial Cross commemorating the 132 men who had made the supreme sacrifice in war. On the cross it bears the following inscription;\nFacilities.\nThe village has a Methodist church, known as Tamar Valley Methodist Church.

        "title": "Hersham",
        "text": "Hersham is a town in Surrey, within the M25. It has a mixture of low and high rise housing and it has four technology/trading estates. The only contiguous settlement is Walton-on-Thames, its post town.\nHersham is served by Hersham and Walton-on-Thames railway stations with a minimum of two trains per hour and differing types of services on the South West Main Line.\nTwo golf courses are within its bounds, Burhill Golf Club and Hersham Village Golf Club; considerable other land is wooded, used for mixed farming or Esher Rugby Club, much of which is Metropolitan Green Belt.\nHistory.\nAccording to \"Hersham in Surrey\":\nThat this could have been constructed at all indicates a fairly large population in the district, a chieftain of some sort, organised labour and a desperate perhaps recurring danger. Bronze and Iron Age burials have been found on the slopes of the hill which was clearly a feature of some importance in ancient times.\nThe Anglo-Saxons may well have been the first permanent settlers here; they gave the name to the place and no older remains of actual dwellings in areas not mentioned above have been found. In the 12th century it was written Haverichesham suggesting Haeferick's hamlet or river bend settlement. By contraction the name become Haverisham, Haversham, Harsham or Hersham before finally settling only on the latter.\nHersham's first chapel of ease (Holy Trinity church, which was demolished in 1889 having been superseded) was built of yellow brick in Anglo-Norman style in 1839. Similarly congregationalists had a Round Chapel which existed from 1844 until 1961, the year in which the single dual carriageway in Hersham was created, and enabling its construction.\nInstead of merely (for vestry and property owning matters such as poor relief, road maintenance, manorial ownership, land tax and tithes) being the southern hamlet of Walton, Hersham became an ecclesiastical parish in 1851. The dividing line was what then officially termed the \"London and South Western Railway line\" and all borders remain almost unchanged by later local government and ecclesiastical parish decisions. The present Anglican church of St. Peter was built by Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A., in 1887 on a site was given by Lieut. Col. Terry of Burvale, Hersham. It is of brick and stone in 13th-century style, has a nave and aisles, five arcades, chancel, transepts, and a western tower and spire.\nHersham has an interesting industrial history with notable companies such as ABC Motors, Air Products, Faulkners, Hackbridge &amp; Hewittick and Vickers-Armstrongs all having factories in the village during the last century. In 1929 an aeroplane designed by Anthony Fletcher was constructed in the village by ABC Motors. Designed by Anthony Fletcher and fitted with an ABC Scorpion aero engine, this was test flown from nearby Brooklands and had could have been built in quantity but became a victim of the economic depression of 1929-32. Other specialist Hersham firms include coachbuilders Compton &amp; Herman Ltd based in Molesey Road in the 1920s before being renamed Compton Motor Body Builders and later moving first to Kingston and then to New Malden.\nIn World War II, in a daring daylight raid on 4 September 1940, German bombers successfully attacked the important Vickers aircraft factory at Brooklands killing nearly 90 people. Four of the victims were never identified but buried in Hersham's Burvale Cemetery and another Vickers worker, 36 year old William E Hunt, was buried close by. Luftwaffe bombers also dropped various bombs on and around Hersham and six V-1 flying bombs exploded in the parish. Besides the significant contribution of ABC Motors to the British war effort with products that included auxiliary power units for Short Sunderland flying boats), Vickers-Armstrongs had four secret production sites in the village and its surrounding parish occupied the existing Ben Stanley Ltd bus depot and workshop in Burwood Road as part of its dispersed Tinsmiths Department. Known as depot 'W15', this site supplied essential sheet metal parts parts for Vickers Wellington and Vickers Warwick aircraft manufactured at Brooklands. The other locations were at Burhill Golf Club ('W32'- see below) plus Corbie Wood ('W86' which included both a Bellman hangar and an Air Ministry T.2 Type hangar) and Riseholme ('W63'), both located on the St George's Hill side of Seven Hills Road.\nHersham contained one manor alone known as Morehall alias Sylkesmore or Southwood. Mention of a court held at Hersham in 1272 by Reginald de Imworth and Matilda his wife, may indicate that he was then lord of the manor. When Henry VIII built Nonsuch Palace in Cheam as many as eighty loads of timber were obtained from Southwood, or the South Woods, for it. In 1540 he purchased from John Carleton the \"manor of Morehall or Sylkesmore\" in Hersham, together with lands and woods in Burwood and Hatch in Hersham. The manor remained in the possession of the Crown, and was granted by Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England to David Vincent. In 1579 Queen Elizabeth granted to Thomas Vincent \"the manor, site, and demesne lands of Morehall, and the wood called Sylkesmore coppice\". In the 18th century and until 1802 at least, the estate, then known as 'the manor of Southwood and Silksmore,' appears to have been held by the Frederick family.\nThis private retirement village, which allocates some of its accommodation to disabled poor residents, is set in a lightly undulating, elevated, wooded part of Hersham and was created from a bequest of \u00a31m left by a London department store pioneer William Whiteley.\nGeography.\nHersham is in the borough of Elmbridge, in northwest Surrey and has no particular sub-localities except for Burwood Park, which alongside certain other addresses in the village is, when published for any purposes, due to its proximity to Walton-on-Thames railway station, done so under the name of Hersham's post town only, Walton on Thames. A planned community also exists in the south almost entirely for the retired, Whiteley Village.\nIn the nucleus of the village is Hersham Green, of open space on which regular events take place throughout the year. Just across from the green is a shopping centre, consisting of multiple shops and restaurants. Within a few minutes walk of the village centre in the east are green fields and meadows alongside the River Mole and footpaths both through and by fields used for mixed farming.\nThe parish boundaries run from the South West Main Line railway in the North to the East and through St George's Hill in the West.\nPlaces within Hersham therefore technically include part of Saint George's Hill, all of Burwood Park and Whiteley Village.\nNotable events.\nKing George III visited Weylands farm in Hersham where he saw the first drill plough. Queen Victoria wrote in her diary how she saw her first steam train in Hersham when she was a young girl.\nIn more recent times the punk group Sham 69 with lead singer Jimmy Pursey, had its roots in Hersham. The band's biggest hit was \"Hersham Boys\". Sham 69 took their name from the remnants of a piece of graffiti in the area which made reference to when Walton and Hersham Football Club secured the Athenian League title in 1969.\nDue to its proximity to London and Shepperton Studios, Hersham is frequently a filming location for film and television productions including \"Nighty Night\", \"The Glass\", and \"Monty Python\" The second series of the TV show, \"Ashes to Ashes\" was filmed in Hersham. \"The Mummy\" was filmed in Hersham. The TV Show \"Not Going Out is filmed in Hersham as was Never the Twain and several TV and Film advertisements\nHersham is also home to Britain's largest colony of parakeets near Esher Rugby Club. This was estimated in 2004 to have consisted of around 7,000 birds.\nEducation.\nWithin Hersham is the mixed, secondary Three Rivers Academy. The school holds specialist Business and Enterprise College status, and boasts an impressive drama programme. Its roll holds approx. 1200 students. Hersham also has three primary schools \u2013 Burhill, became primary in 2015, Bell Farm, became primary in 2014 and Cardinal Newman.\nSport.\nRugby.\nEsher RFC is a multi-pitch rugby union club in Hersham since approximately 1939 (see notes). Their first men's team is notable in the region and saw 2012-14 among the upper 50% of clubs in RFU National League 1 (the third level of the sport in England), having been relegated in the previous season. Esher play at The Rugby Ground, 369 Molesey Road. The 1st XV play in a black-amber strip.\nTV presenter John Inverdale has long been associated with the club, albeit the 2010s saw his involvement diminish.\nGolf.\nHersham Village Golf Club is on the south side of the village; snooker player John Virgo is a former president.\nHersham's large second golf club is Burhill Golf Club (with North and South courses, the latter of which has been added near Burwood Park. Early in World War II, Barnes Wallis and several hundred staff were evacuated to Burhill Golf Club from the nearby Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands and designed the legendary Dambusters 'bouncing bomb' there.\nEconomy.\nFour technology/trading estates exist in Hersham:\nA major nearby conjoined set of trading estates spans the Weybridge/Byfleet border at Brooklands and Heathrow Airport also has a range of employers, though this is across Walton-on-Thames itself and the borough of Spelthorne. Most important to the local economy is the accessibility of Central London \u2013 see Rail below, with more than 500,000 train entries and exits per annum recorded across the two stations bordering and in the village itself.\nThe very modest High Street contains almost entirely only convenience and socialising stores; fashion and leisure shops are to be found less than to the north, in Walton on Thames. As part of the development of Hersham a new shopping centre was built in the early 1980s with a large supermarket (30k sq feet ) now occupied by Waitrose, although the whole complex is currently under consideration for major redevelopment by the owners.\nAnother well-established commercial business is the popular Squires Garden Centre adjacent to the Burvale Cemetery in Burwood Road.\nA new Lidl supermarket was given permission in 2015 and subsequently opened on a site formerly used by ABC Motors and latterly by Ian Allan Publishing, increasing Hersham's retail floor-space in addition to Waitrose.\nTransport.\nRail.\nHersham is served by Hersham and Walton-on-Thames railway stations with a minimum of two trains per hour even on Sundays and differing types of services on the South West Main Line. Fast trains stopping at Walton-on-Thames reach London Waterloo within 30 minutes.\nRoads.\nThe M25 Junction 10 is 4 miles away and an A-roads and dual carriageway connect neighbouring (but not contiguous) Esher and the almost bordering towns of Weybridge and Cobham, across a narrow strip of Walton on Thames.\nDemography and housing.\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\nThe proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free)."

        "text": "Kapilar or Kabilar (Tamil: \u0b95\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bb0\u0bcd) was the most prolific Tamil poet of the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE). He alone contributed some 206 poems, or a little less than 10% of the entire Sangam-era classical corpus by 473 ancient poets. Held in high regard by other poets of the Sangam era, as well as the post-Sangam era, he is variously dated to have lived between c. 50\u2013125 CE, or 140\u2013200 CE.\nHe was a contemporary of Karikala Chola, Irunk\u014dv\u0113l and V\u0113l P\u0101ri. He was the close friend, confidant and alleged favorite of V\u0113l P\u0101ri, one of the V\u0113lir kings. He was the author of Inna Narpathu, a didactic work of the Sangam literature. Verse 5 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai is also attributed to him.\nEarly life.\nKapilar was born in Thiruvadhavur in the Pandyan Kingdom. Initially a poet at the Pandyan court, he left Madurai at an early age to travel across various kingdoms. Kapilar heard about the generosity and virtue of V\u0113l P\u0101ri, a powerful V\u0113lir King who ruled over Parambun\u0101du and paid him a visit. He became a friend and confidant of P\u0101ri and stayed with him until the latter's death, serving as the chief poet and minister at the P\u0101ri's court. Kowmareeshwari suggests he was born about mid 1st-century CE, while Martha Ann Shelby states he most likely was born about 140 CE.\nKapilar sang about a number of kings such as Agudhai, Irungovel, Selva Kadungo Vazhiyadhan, Cheramaan Maandharancheral Irumborai, Ori, Nalli, Malayamaan Thirumudikkaari, Malayan, Vichikkon, Vaiyavi Koperum Pegan, Vel Pari. Kapilar has sung on King Selva Kadungovaliyadhan, which appears as the seventh group of verses in the Pathitrupathu. The king honoured Kapilar with 100,000 gold coins and a country under his control. Kapilar remained close with other contemporary poets such as Avvaiyar and Paranar.\nSiege of Parambu.\nThe three crowned Tamil kings Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas expanded their kingdoms ruthlessly and turned their attention towards independent V\u0113lir Kings thus turning them into subordinates or eliminating them to annexe their kingdoms. They laid siege to the heavily fortified country of Parambu, but V\u0113l P\u0101ri refused to give in and the war dragged for years. Kabilar approached the kings and asked them to turn back describing his patron Pari as an unconquerable warrior (excerpt from Purananuru: song 109):\nAfter a long war, V\u0113l P\u0101ri was killed by treachery. Purananuru, song (112) of P\u0101ri's daughters on his death:\nAftermath and death.\nKapilar become the guardian of P\u0101ri's two daughters, Angavai and Sangavai, after Pari's death and the three of them left Parambu country. Kapilar unsuccessfully approached different V\u0113lir kings to find grooms. He would be let down each time as the other V\u0113lir kings would fear retribution from the three crowned kingdoms. The most notable of these encounters is when he sings to Irunk\u014dv\u0113l and the latter would insult Kabilar. He would finally leave the two princesses in the care of \"Andhanars\". Later, poet Avvaiyar takes care of them and marries them off successfully into the family of another V\u0113lir king Malaiyamaan Kaari.\nThe death of his friend P\u0101ri affected Kapilar and he later took his own life by \"vadakirrutal\", one of the Tamil ways of committing suicide. He sat facing north and starved himself to death in Kabilar Kundru.\nWorks and contribution.\nKabilar made huge contributions to Tamil literature of Sangam era. \"Kurincippattu\" is a poetic work in the Ten Idylls series of the Eighteen Greater Texts anthology in Tamil literature containing 261 lines of poems in the \"Achiriyappa\" meter written by Kabilar. An ancient note states that Kapilar wrote this to explain the beauty of Tamil poetry to a north Indian king names Brhadatta. Kurincippattu describes the \"kurinchi\" landscape of the mountainous terrain and mentions almost 100 different plant names. Kabilar also contributed to Pu\u1e5fan\u0101\u1e49\u016b\u1e5fu in the Eight Anthologies series of sangam literature. Kapilar used unique metaphors that show the interior landscape using the objects seen in the 'Kurinchi' landscape. 'Veral veli' written by Kapilar is considered as one of the master pieces.\nViews on Valluvar and the Kural.\nKapilar is believed to have accompanied Valluvar in his journey to the Madurai College of scholars to present the latter\u2019s work, the Tirukkural. Verse 5 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai is attributed to Kapilar. He opines about Valluvar and the Kural text thus:"

        "text": "Mary Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Chamberlain) Bassett (1855 or 1858\u2013December 1892), commonly known as Elizabeth and Eliza Bassett, was a Wild West pioneer, cattle rancher, and cattle rustler. Born in Magnet Cove, Arkansas, and raised by her maternal grandparents, Bassett grew up in an equestrian household and community. As a young woman, she migrated west with her husband Herbert Bassett and their young daughter. Mary Eliza (as she was called during childhood) changed her name to Elizabeth when she moved Westward. By all accounts, Elizabeth was a strong, outdoorsy woman, and her marriage to Herb Bassett was unusually open-minded for the era. The Bassetts lived and worked according to their specific talents and interests, rather than traditional gender roles. Elizabeth ran the cattle and sheep ranch, and raised thoroughbred horses. Her husband Herb managed the agricultural operations and taught their children. When large cattle companies began to push out small cattle ranchers and homesteaders, Bassett organized other locals to fight back. Her daughters Ann and Josie Bassett became notable in their own right. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were close family friends of the Bassetts, and often stayed and worked at the ranch to \"cool down\" following their illegal escapades.\nEarly life.\nMary Eliza Chamberlain, born 1855, was the daughter of Hannah Emerson Miller (1840-1861) and Ewell Chamberlain (1825-1864), a Confederate Sergeant during the Civil War who was wounded on May 6, 1864 and died on June 16, 1864, in Lynchburg, Virginia of his wounds, following amputation of his leg.\nHaving lost her mother Hannah when Mary Eliza was only 6, and her father to the Civil War, Mary Eliza was separated from her baby sister and taken in to live with her maternal grandparents, the Millers, on their homestead in Magnet Cove, Arkansas. Her father was at war when her mother died giving birth to her baby sister, and Mary and the baby were probably presumed to be at the Miller home temporarily until their father returned home from war. He died in Lynchburg in 1864, and Mary Eliza remained with the Millers while her sister Hannah was sent to live with an elderly aunt.\nHer maternal grandfather was George (aka \"Judge\") Crawford Miller and her grandmother was Mary Miller (n\u00e9e Emerson). Her other grandfather William Chamberlain lived just up the road, but was widowed before Mary Eliza was born, and would not have been considered suitable to raise two granddaughters.\nHer daughter Ann said of her:\nMarriage.\nIn 1868, Mary Eliza Chamberlain met Amos Herbert Bassett, a former Union soldier, when he arrived in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Herbert served the Union Army during the Civil War. After the war, he worked for the Internal Revenue Service as a collector in Illinois, Virginia and Arkansas. In March 1871, Mary Eliza's grandfather George Crawford Miller died intestate, and his belongings were divided among his surviving family members, including Mary Eliza. In September of that year, Herbert and Eliza were wed in Hot Springs. Only a few years later, they headed west via train to Rock Springs, Wyoming, and then south along the Green River, where they visited Herbert's brother Samuel Clark Bassett, who was a United States government scout along the Overland Trail. In 1877, the Bassett family, which now included daughter Josie and son Sam, moved to the rugged frontier area of Browns Park, known for \"cattle rustling and outlaw sheltering\". Their daughter Ann was born in 1878. She was the first white child born in Browns Park. Herbert, a scholar and musician in weak health, was out of place in an area that required hard labor. Bassett realized that she needed to provide a living for the family and became a cattle rancher and rustler. She relied on Isam Dart, who was a ranch hand who also cooked meals, washed laundry, cut wood, and performed other household duties for the family. Josie and Ann attended Miss Porter's select Finishing School for Girls in Boston for a proper education, and they were also proficient horseback riders and ropers. Elizabeth advocated for women's right to vote, was interested in feminism, and believed in one's roles should be based upon talent and interest, rather than gender. Herbert schooled the children and she ran the ranch.\nRanch and farm.\nThe Bassetts were among the first homesteaders at Browns Park, located within a valley that is five miles wide and thirty miles long. The area was good for cattle ranching, where the surrounding mountains protected the valley against the cold winter weather. In addition, there was an abundance of sweet grass and fresh water. In 1878, the Bassetts built a log house, with a well-stocked library, for their cattle ranch. It was located near the entrance to Lodore Canyon and alongside a clear mountain spring. The house was partially furnished from belongings that she inherited from her Arkansas grandfather's estate, combined with furniture hand-made locally of wood, leather, and buckskin.\nThe initial years were hard. Bassett hunted wild game. The Native Americans taught them how to fish, what plants to harvest, and how to make jerky. The Bassetts grew grain and hay and raised horses, cattle, and sheep. They welcomed day and overnight visitors and they participated in and hosted dances. Bassett was kind to her family, neighbors, and ranch hands. Members of the Wild Bunch, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, often stayed at the ranch to \"cool off.\" They worked as ranch hands and were close friends of the Bassett family. Butch Cassidy hid at the ranch after he robbed the Telluride Bank in 1889.\nFollowing the Meeker Massacre (1879), Herbert took the children to Rock Springs in Wyoming to avoid hostilities between the Ute People and the United States government. Bassett wanted to stay behind to oversee the ranch, but Herbert was adamant that she leave with the rest of the family. One year later, they returned to their ranch to find it had not been burned down as feared. She focused much of her attention on breeding thoroughbred horses, which was her passion. Herbert planted an orchard and grew plants in the family's garden.\nAs investors and cattle monopolies sought to move Native Americans to reservations, relinquishing more prime land, they began to buy large tracts of land and began to push out homesteaders and small ranches. The large concerns, backed by the influential Wyoming Stock Growers Association, sought to create a poor opinion of the smaller ranches in the press by claiming that they were cattle rustlers. A former practice of a community-based roundup of cattle and grouping them by brand ended when the large cattle ranchers rounded up large numbers of cattle, without sorting out the cattle by brand.\nBassett Gang.\nBassett decided to band together with other small ranches and homesteaders to prevent cattle from large ranches from grazing on their land. Some also rustled cattle to make up for their cattle that had been rounded up by the large ranches.\nBassett became the leader of what was called the Bassett Gang, which included Isam Dart, Matt Rash, Jim McKnight, and Angus McDougal. She was a charming woman, skilled in riding horses, shooting rifles, and executing her plans. Bassett honored treaties made with Native Americans.\nAccording to John Rolfe Burroughs, author of \"Where the Old West Stayed Young\", \"Technically, rustling cattle was a felony offense. It is not an exaggeration to say, however, that with very few exceptions, everybody. . .in Brown's Park engaged in it.\"\nDeath.\nBassett died of an internal injury\u2014such as a burst appendix or complication of pregnancy\u2014in December 1892."

        "title": "Kawasaki Vulcan",
        "text": "The Vulcan name has been used by Kawasaki for their custom or touring bike since 1984, model designation VN, using mostly V-twin engines ranging from .\nModel history.\n1984\u20132006: Vulcan 750 series.\nIn 1985 Kawasaki launched, worldwide, the Vulcan VN700A, its first cruiser powered by its first V-twin engine. The VN700A has a shaft drive. Kawasaki also made the now rare VZ 750 variant with chromed wheel arches and other subtle differences. To avoid United States tariffs on Japanese motorcycles over 700cc, the initial US model was limited to 699\u00a0cc but in 1986, the tariff was lifted so the engine capacity was increased to 749\u00a0cc. Apart from paint schemes the Vulcan remained largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor adjustments to components.\n1986\u20132004: Vulcan 400 series.\nKawasaki introduced the Vulcan 400 in 1986 as an entry level cruiser. For a first series, the Vulcan 400 featured a 398\u00a0cc liquid-cooled twin engine, and was fitted with a belt drive and six-speed transmission. The series 2 Vulcan 400 featured a 399\u00a0cc liquid-cooled V-twin engine similar in design to the 750. The series 2 was fitted with a chain drive and five-speed transmission to reduce cost and was produced in both \"Classic\" and \"Drifter\" variations.\n1990\u20132009: Vulcan 500 series.\nThe Vulcan 500 (EN500A) introduced in 1990 was the successor to the Kawasaki 454 LTD. The EN500A was fitted with a parallel twin 498\u00a0cc engine nearly identical to the Kawasaki Ninja 500R. It had a 6-speed transmission and belt final drive. The EN500A was discontinued after 1996 and replaced with the Vulcan 500 LTD (EN500C). Both versions were available as 1996 models. With the EN500C the ergonomics changed as well as the engine tuning. New cam shaft profiles and slightly lower compression pistons moved the power band down to increase low end torque. Also the carburetors were downsized from 34mm to 32mm. The belt final drive was replaced with a chain. The Vulcan 500 LTD was discontinued after the 2009 model year for a nearly 20 year production run.\n2015\u2013present: Vulcan 650 S Series.\nThe Vulcan 650 S (EN650AF/BF) is designated as a Sport cruiser. Introduced in 2015 with an Ergo-Fit system designed for better custom comfort adjustability for different rider sizes. A choice of three foot peg positions, three seats and two handlebars are available to choose from, at time of purchase. The engine is a 649cc parallel twin derived from the Ninja 650. Retuned, heavier flywheel and redesigned intake give the Vulcan S more low and mid range torque. It has very non traditional cruiser looks with a unique frame and suspension layout.\nAll Specs via \n1987\u20132008: Vulcan 88/1500 series.\nThe Vulcan 88 was introduced in 1987 and was immediately seen as a shot across the bow of other big bore motorcycles of the time, notably the Honda Gold Wing (1200cc) and the Harley Davidson Electra Glide (1340cc) \nWith its 1464\u00a0 cc liquid-cooled V-twin design, the 88 was produced from 1987 through 1999. It was immediately dubbed 'The King of the Cruisers' by at least one motorcycle magazine A four-speed transmission was blended with the \"large for its time motor\" and offered consumers a big-bore metric cruiser that was comfortable and relatively light-weight at just over 600\u00a0lbs when \"rider ready\".\nThe Vulcan 1500 Classic, introduced in 1996, had a liquid-cooled SOHC 50\u00b0 V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and a 5 speed transmission. It had a seat height, wide handlebar, and forward-mounted floorboards.\nThe 1500 Meanstreak was introduced in 2002 and lasted 2 years, before giving way to the 1600 Meanstreak. This performance version of the 1500 had the same basic engine as the 1500FI, but sported several upgrades including new camshafts, larger valves, larger fuel injection throttle bodies, new high compression pistons, and re-designed combustion chamber. It also had a slimmed down narrower gas tank. This meant an increase to 72\u00a0hp at 5500rpm and 90\u00a0ft-lbs at 3000rpm, while weighing in at a mere 637\u00a0lbs dry.\nThe Vulcan 1500 Drifter was an homage to the 1948 Indian Chief which began production in 1999 and ceased production in 2005. It is notable for its large Indian-style fenders, wide solo seat, wide handlebars and fringe in several places.\n1995\u20132006: Vulcan 800 series.\nTwo models of the Vulcan, VN800A and VN800B, were discontinued in 2006 with the introduction of the VN900. The VN800A, introduced in 1995 and the first of Kawasaki's modern cruiser style, featured a softail design, bobbed rear fender and a 21-inch front wheel. The VN800B (Classic), introduced in 1996, had a retro styling that featured full fenders and 16-inch wheels on both front and rear.\n2004\u20132010: Vulcan 2000 series.\nBased and built on the same frame, the Vulcan 2000 base model, Classic, and Classic LT have only subtle differences between the variations. The most apparent is the \"bug-eye\" chrome nacelle projection headlight that was first introduced on 2004 Vulcan VN2000A base model. This headlight was the only offering from Kawasaki until the introduction of the Vulcan Classic VN2000D in 2006, which employed a more traditional headlight. Also introduced in 2006, the Vulcan Classic LT VN2000F. The Classic LT had an appearance similar to the Classic but added saddlebags, windshield, passenger floorboards and passenger backrest to the offering. The engine in the VN2000 was briefly the largest displacement production engine in a motorcycle (2053cc/125ci) before it was superseded by the Triumph Rocket 3 later that same year. It remains the largest displacement production V-Twin ever sold, as the Rocket is a Triple (inline 3). In addition to its immense size and power, the VN2000 was different in one other way for Kawasaki. It is their only V-Twin with external lifters, making it unique in the Vulcan lineup and giving it more of a Harley look."

        "text": "Jack M. Balkin (born August 13, 1956) is an American legal scholar. He is the Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School. Balkin is the founder and director of the Yale Information Society Project (ISP), a research center whose mission is \"to study the implications of the Internet, telecommunications, and the new information technologies for law and society.\" He also directs the Knight Law and Media Program and the Abrams Institute for Free Expression at Yale Law School.\nBalkin publishes a legal blog, Balkinization, and is also a correspondent for \"The Atlantic\". He is a scholar of Constitutional and First Amendment law. In addition to his work as a legal scholar, he has also written a book on memes and cultural evolution and has translated and written a commentary on the ancient Chinese Book of Changes, or I Ching.\nBiography.\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri, Balkin received his A.B. and J.D. degrees from Harvard University and his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Cambridge. He clerked for Judge Carolyn Dineen King of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. From 1982 to 1984 he was a litigation associate at the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. He taught at the University of Missouri at Kansas City from 1984 to 1988 and at the University of Texas from 1988 to 1994. He joined the Yale faculty in 1994. He has also taught at Harvard University, New York University, Tel Aviv University, and Queen Mary College at the University of London. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005, and a Member of the American Law Institute in 2020.\nMemetics, ideology, and transcendence.\nBalkin's 1998 book, \"Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology\", argued that ideology could be explained in terms of memes and processes of cultural evolution. He argued that ideology is an effect of the \"cultural software\" or tools of understanding that become part of human beings and that are produced through the evolution and transmission of memes. At the same time, Balkin argued that all ideological and moral analysis presupposes a transcendent ideal of truth and \"a transcendent value of justice.\" Like T. K. Seung, he suggests that a transcendent idea of justice\u2014although incapable of perfect realization and inevitably \"indeterminate\"\u2014underlies political discourse and political persuasion.\nIdeological drift, nested oppositions, and legal semiotics.\nBalkin coined the term \"ideological drift\" to describe a phenomenon by which ideas and concepts change their political valence as they are introduced into new social and political contexts over time. Along with Duncan Kennedy, Balkin developed the field of legal semiotics. Legal semiotics shows how legal arguments feature recurrent tropes or topoi that respond to each other and whose opposition is reproduced at higher and lower levels of doctrinal detail as legal doctrines evolve. Hence Balkin claimed that legal argument has a self-similar \"crystalline\" or fractal structure.\nBalkin employed deconstruction and related literary theories to argue that legal thought was structured in terms of \"nested oppositions\"\u2014opposed ideas or concepts that turn into each other over time or otherwise depend on each other in novel and unexpected ways. Although he draws on literary theory in his work on legal rhetoric, Balkin and his frequent co-author Sanford Levinson contend law is best analogized not to literature but to the performing arts such as music and drama.\nPartisan entrenchment.\nBalkin and Levinson argue that constitutional revolutions in judicial doctrine occur through a process called \"partisan entrenchment\". The party that controls the White House can stock the federal courts with new judges and Justices who have views on key constitutional issues roughly similar to those of the President. This shifts the median Justice on the Supreme Court and changes the complexion of the lower federal courts, which, in turn, eventually affects constitutional doctrine. If enough new judges are appointed in a relatively short period of time, changes will occur more quickly, producing a constitutional revolution. For example, a constitutional revolution occurred following the New Deal because Franklin Roosevelt was able to appoint eight new Supreme Court Justices between 1937 and 1941. Balkin and Levinson's theory contrasts with Bruce Ackerman's theory of constitutional moments, which argues that constitutional revolutions occur because of self-conscious acts of democratic mobilization that establish new standards of political legitimacy. Balkin and Levinson view partisan entrenchment as roughly but imperfectly democratic; it guarantees neither legitimate nor correct constitutional interpretation.\nConstitutional interpretation.\nBalkin's constitutional theory, developed in his 2011 book, \"Living Originalism\", is both originalist and living constitutionalist. He argues that there is no contradiction between these approaches, properly understood. Interpreters must follow the original meaning of the constitutional text but not its original expected application; hence much constitutional interpretation actually involves constitutional construction and state building by all three branches of government. Balkin's \"framework originalism\" views the Constitution as an initial framework for governance that sets politics in motion and makes politics possible; it must be filled out over time through constitutional construction and state building. This process of building out the Constitution is living constitutionalism.\nConstitutional rot.\nBalkin uses the term \"constitutional rot\" to describe the process by which democracies become less responsive to public will and less devoted to the public good over time. Constitutional rot grows because of (1) increasing inequalities of income and wealth; (2) increasing political polarization and tribalism; (3) loss of trust between members of different parties and between the public and established institutions; and (4) policy disasters that show that government officials are not competent and/or cannot be trusted. Balkin argues that the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that all republics would decay over time, and they designed the Constitution so that it could ride out periods of constitutional rot in the hopes of a later renewal of republican institutions. Many of the Constitution's features, including staggered terms for the President, House, and Senate, separation of powers, federalism, and an independent judiciary, are forms of \"republican insurance\" designed to achieve this goal.\nBalkin distinguishes constitutional rot from constitutional crisis. Constitutional crisis is a period in which people reasonably believe that constitutional institutions are about to fail or have failed. Because a key purpose of constitutions is to make politics possible, constitutions fail when people no longer try to struggle for power within the terms of the constitution. This may result in political paralysis, or in civil war, insurrections, secession, or attempted coups. Although the two concepts of crisis and rot are distinct, Balkin argues that an advanced case of constitutional rot can generate a constitutional crisis.\nConstitutional crisis.\nBalkin and Levinson offer a typology of constitutional crises. In Type One crises, political actors publicly announce that they will no longer abide by the constitution and disobey direct judicial orders. In Type Two crises, fidelity to the constitution leads to disaster, because people think that the Constitution prevents them from acting or because they believe that the Constitution does not provide for a certain event so that paralysis occurs and disaster strikes. In a Type Three crisis, people disagree so strongly about what the constitution means that they turn to civil war, secession, or insurrection. Balkin and Levinson believe real constitutional crises are rare in American history, although political crises are frequent. A test of a successful constitution is whether it can successfully manage and resolve political crises within its boundaries.\nConstitutional cycles.\nBalkin argues that America's constitutional system evolves through the interplay between three cycles: the rise and fall of dominant political parties, the waxing and waning of political polarization, and alternating episodes of constitutional rot and constitutional renewal. Balkin explains that America's politics seems especially fraught because America is nearing the end of the Republican Party's long political dominance, is at the height of a long cycle of political polarization, and is suffering from an advanced case of constitutional rot. Balkin argues that America is in a Second Gilded Age, and predicts that it is slowly moving toward a second Progressive Era.\nFreedom of speech and democratic culture.\nBalkin's work on the First Amendment argues that the purpose of the free speech principle is to promote what he calls a democratic culture. The idea of democratic culture is broader than a concern with democratic deliberation or democratic self-government, and emphasizes individual freedom, cultural participation and mutual influence. A democratic culture is one in which ordinary individuals can participate in the forms of culture that in turn help shape and constitute them as persons. Balkin argues that free speech on the Internet is characterized by two features: \"routing around\" media gatekeepers, and \"glomming on\"\u2014non-exclusive appropriation of cultural content that is melded with other sources to create new forms of culture. These distinctive features of Internet speech, he argues, are actually features of speech in general and thus lead to a focus on democratic participation in culture.\nBalkin argues that protection of freedom of speech in the digital age will increasingly rely less on judge-made doctrines of the First Amendment and more on legislation, administrative regulation, and technological design. He argues that we have moved beyond the traditional dyadic model of free expression in which nation states regulated the speech of their citizens. Instead, digital speech involves a pluralist model. In the pluralist model, territorial governments continue to regulate speech directly. But they also attempt to coerce or co-opt owners of digital infrastructure to regulate the speech of others. This is \"new school\" speech regulation. Digital infrastructure owners, and especially social media companies, now act as private governors of speech communities, creating and enforcing various rules and norms of the communities they govern. Finally, end users, civil society organizations, hackers, and other private actors repeatedly put pressure on digital infrastructure companies to regulate speech in certain ways and not to regulate it in others. This triangular tug of war\u2014rather than the traditional dyadic model of states regulating the speech of private parties\u2014characterizes the practical ability to speak in the algorithmic society.\nThe National Surveillance State.\nIn a 2006 essay with Levinson, and a 2008 article, Balkin discusses the emergence of a \"National Surveillance State\" that uses the collection, collation and analysis of information to govern. The National Surveillance State is a natural byproduct of technological development and demands for government services. Balkin argues that \"[t]he question is not whether we will have a surveillance state in the years to come, but what sort of surveillance state we will have.\"\nBalkin distinguishes between two models: an authoritarian information state and a democratic information state. Authoritarian information states are information misers and information gluttons: they collect as much information as possible and they resist sharing it or making their own operations public. Democratic information states are information gourmets and information philanthropists: they collect only what they need, they produce information for and share information with their citizens and they make their own operations democratically accountable. Democratic information states also destroy government collected information when it is no longer necessary. In practice, much privacy protection came from the fact that people forgot what had happened. But in the digital age, nothing is ever forgotten, so appropriate discarding of the results of government surveillance must be mandated.\nAs the surveillance state grows, Balkin argues, new civil liberties protections are necessary, just as they were necessary with the growth of the administrative state after the New Deal and the National Security State after World War II. The executive branch must be redesigned with internal checks and balances to police itself, to report on its activities, and to prevent abuse. Finally, technology must be used to record what officials do and look for signs of government misconduct: \"The best way to control the watchers is to watch them as well.\"\nInformation fiduciaries, robotics, and artificial intelligence.\nBalkin coined the term \"information fiduciary\" to describe the legal and ethical obligations of digital businesses and social media companies. He argues that people must trust and depend on certain digital businesses and social media companies, and are especially vulnerable to them. Therefore, the digital age has produced a new kind of fiduciary obligation analogous to those the law imposes on money managers and on professionals like doctors, lawyers, and accountants.\nBalkin argues that digital information fiduciaries must act in a trustworthy fashion toward their end-users. They must respect end-user privacy and may not manipulate end-users. Those who develop and employ robots, artificial intelligence agents, and algorithms may also be information fiduciaries toward their customers and end-users. In addition, firms may not engage in \"algorithmic nuisance\": using people's digital identities to discriminate and manipulate them and shifting the costs of algorithmic decisionmaking onto the general public.\nBalkin argues that the obligations of information fiduciaries and the duty not to be algorithmic nuisances are part of new laws of robotics. Unlike Asimov's famous three laws of robotics, these laws are directed not to robots but to the people and organizations who design, own, and operate them. Balkin argues that robotic and artificial intelligence technologies mediate relationships of power between different groups of people; therefore law must focus on regulating the people, firms, and social groups who use robots and artificial intelligence as much as on the technologies themselves."

        "title": "Schema matching",
        "text": "The terms schema matching and \"mapping\" are often used interchangeably for a database process. For this article, we differentiate the two as follows: schema matching is the process of identifying that two objects are semantically related (scope of this article) while mapping refers to the transformations between the objects. For example, in the two schemas DB1.Student (Name, SSN, Level, Major, Marks)\nand DB2.Grad-Student (Name, ID, Major, Grades); possible matches would be: DB1.Student \u2248 DB2.Grad-Student; DB1.SSN = DB2.ID etc. and possible transformations or mappings would be: DB1.Marks to DB2.Grades (100-90 A; 90-80 B: etc.).\nAutomating these two approaches has been one of the fundamental tasks of data integration. In general, it is not possible to determine fully automatically the different correspondences between two schemas \u2014 primarily because of the differing and often not explicated or documented semantics of the two schemas.\nImpediments.\nAmong others, common challenges to automating matching and mapping have been previously classified in especially for relational DB schemas; and in \u2013 a fairly comprehensive list of heterogeneity not limited to the relational model recognizing schematic vs semantic differences/heterogeneity. Most of these heterogeneities exist because schemas use different representations or definitions to represent the same information (schema conflicts); OR different expressions, units, and precision result in conflicting representations of the same data (data conflicts).\nResearch in schema matching seeks to provide automated support to the process of finding semantic matches between two schemas. This process is made harder due to heterogeneities at the following levels\nSchema matching.\nMethodology.\nDiscusses a generic methodology for the task of schema integration or the activities involved. According to the authors, one can view the integration.\nApproaches.\nApproaches to schema integration can be broadly classified as ones that exploit either just schema information or schema and instance level information.\nSchema-level matchers only consider schema information, not instance data. The available information includes the usual properties of schema elements, such as name, description, data type, relationship types (part-of, is-a, etc.), constraints, and schema structure. Working at the element (atomic elements like attributes of objects) or structure level (matching combinations of elements that appear together in a structure), these properties are used to identify matching elements in two schemas. Language-based or linguistic matchers use names and text (i.e., words or sentences) to find semantically similar schema elements. Constraint based matchers exploit constraints often contained in schemas. Such constraints are used to define data types and value ranges, uniqueness, optionality, relationship types and cardinalities, etc. Constraints in two input schemas are matched to determine the similarity of the schema elements.\nInstance-level matchers use instance-level data to gather important insight into the contents and meaning of the schema elements. These are typically used in addition to schema level matches in order to boost the confidence in match results, more so when the information available at the schema level is insufficient. Matchers at this level use linguistic and constraint based characterization of instances. For example, using linguistic techniques, it might be possible to look at the Dept, DeptName and EmpName instances to conclude that DeptName is a better match candidate for Dept than EmpName. Constraints like zipcodes must be 5 digits long or format of phone numbers may allow matching of such types of instance data.\nHybrid matchers directly combine several matching approaches to determine match candidates based on multiple criteria or information sources.\n\"Most of these techniques also employ additional information such as dictionaries, thesauri, and user-provided match or mismatch information\"\nReusing matching information\nAnother initiative has been to re-use previous matching information as auxiliary information for future matching tasks. The motivation for this work is that structures or substructures often repeat, for example in schemas in the E-commerce domain. Such a reuse of previous matches however needs to be a careful choice. It is possible that such a reuse makes sense only for some part of a new schema or only in some domains. For example, Salary and Income may be considered identical in a payroll application but not in a tax reporting application. There are several open ended challenges in such reuse that deserves further work.\nSample Prototypes\nTypically, the implementation of such matching techniques can be classified as being either rule based or learner based systems. The complementary nature of these different approaches has instigated a number of applications using a combination of techniques depending on the nature of the domain or application under consideration.\nIdentified relationships.\nThe relationship types between objects that are identified at the end of a matching process are typically those with set semantics such as overlap, disjointness, exclusion, equivalence, or subsumption. The logical encodings of these relationships are what they mean. Among others, an early attempt to use description logics for schema integration and identifying such relationships was presented. Several state of the art matching tools today and those benchmarked in the \"Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative\" are capable of identifying many such simple (1:1 / 1:n / n:1 element level matches) and complex matches (n:1 / n:m element or structure level matches) between objects.\nEvaluation of quality.\nThe quality of schema matching is commonly measured by precision and recall. While precision measures the number of correctly matched pairs out of all pairs that \nwere matched, recall measures how many of the actual pairs have been matched."

        "title": "Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem",
        "text": "In mathematics, the Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem is a result about injectivity and surjectivity of polynomials that was proved independently by James Ax and Alexander Grothendieck.\nThe theorem is often given as this special case: If \"P\" is an injective polynomial function from an \"n\"-dimensional complex vector space to itself then \"P\" is bijective. That is, if \"P\" always maps distinct arguments to distinct values, then the values of \"P\" cover all of C\"n\".\nThe full theorem generalizes to any algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field.\nProof via finite fields.\nGrothendieck's proof of the theorem is based on proving the analogous theorem for finite fields and their algebraic closures. That is, for any field \"F\" that is itself finite or that is the closure of a finite field, if a polynomial \"P\" from \"Fn\" to itself is injective then it is bijective.\nIf \"F\" is a finite field, then \"Fn\" is finite. In this case the theorem is true for trivial reasons having nothing to do with the representation of the function as a polynomial: any injection of a finite set to itself is a bijection. When \"F\" is the algebraic closure of a finite field, the result follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. The Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem for complex numbers can therefore be proven by showing that a counterexample over C would translate into a counterexample in some algebraic extension of a finite field.\nThis method of proof is noteworthy in that it is an example of the idea that finitistic algebraic relations in fields of characteristic 0 translate into algebraic relations over finite fields with large characteristic. Thus, one can use the arithmetic of finite fields to prove a statement about C even though there is no homomorphism from any finite field to C. The proof thus uses model-theoretic principles such as the compactness theorem to prove an elementary statement about polynomials. The proof for the general case uses a similar method.\nOther proofs.\nThere are other proofs of the theorem. Armand Borel gave a proof using topology. The case of \"n\" = 1 and field C follows since C is algebraically closed and can also be thought of as a special case of the result that for any analytic function \"f\" on C, injectivity of \"f\" implies surjectivity of \"f\". This is a corollary of Picard's theorem.\nRelated results.\nAnother example of reducing theorems about morphisms of finite type to finite fields can be found in EGA IV: There, it is proved that a radicial \"S\"-endomorphism of a scheme \"X\" of finite type over \"S\" is bijective (10.4.11), and that if \"X\"/\"S\" is of finite presentation, and the endomorphism is a monomorphism, then it is an automorphism (17.9.6). Therefore, a scheme of finite presentation over a base \"S\" is a cohopfian object in the category of \"S\"-schemes.\nThe Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem may also be used to prove the Garden of Eden theorem, a result that like the Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem relates injectivity with surjectivity but in cellular automata rather than in algebraic fields. Although direct proofs of this theorem are known, the proof via the Ax\u2013Grothendieck theorem extends more broadly, to automata acting on amenable groups.\nSome partial converses to the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem:"

        "text": "Gaius Porcius Cato (1st century BC) was a distant relative, probably a second cousin, of the more famous Marcus Porcius Cato, called Cato the Younger. This Cato was probably the son of Gaius Porcius Cato, the homonymous consul of 114 BC, being then the grandson of Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus and thereby the great-grandson of the famous Cato the Censor, often called Cato the Elder.\nGaius Porcius Cato was a client (an adherent) of triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus and was an ally of Clodius (Publius Clodius Pulcher) the infamous Patrician tribune of the plebs, in his street gang war against Milo (Titus Annius Milo). He attacked Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 59 BC by prosecuting a follower, Gabinius, for \"ambitus\" (political corruption) but was thwarted by a Pompeian praetor and was chased from the rostra by an angry crowd. In 57 BC he spoke against delaying the aedelician elections (Clodius was standing and Milo wanted the delay to allow a prosecution).\nTribunate.\nCato served as a plebeian tribune himself in 56 BC, and in his political activities, he was usually associated with his colleague Nonius Sufenas. During their tribunate, they worked for the so-called First triumvirate of Gaius Julius Caesar, Crassus and Pompey, now allied with his benefactor Crassus, and delayed the \"comitia\" to promote the election of Pompey and Crassus as consuls. The following year, after his tribunate, Cato and Sufenas were both accused of procedural violations. Although Cato's prosecutor in the trial was the future Caesarian historian Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC) they were both acquitted. Cato may have won a praetorship in 55 BC, but T.

        "title": "Education in Kerala",
        "text": "The importance and antiquity of education in Kerala are underscored by the state's ranking as among the most literate in the country. The educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries, who were the pioneers that promoted mass education in Kerala, in the early decades of the 19th century. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala\u2014primarily the Travancore Royal Family, the Nair Service Society, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam) and Muslim Educational Society (MES)\u2014also made significant contribution to the progress on education in Kerala. Local schools were known by the general word \"kalaris\", some of which taught martial arts, but other village schools run by Ezhuthachans were for imparting general education. Christian missionaries and British rule brought the modern school education system to Kerala. Ezhuthu palli was the name used in earlier times. The word was derived from the schools run by the Buddhist monasteries. For centuries villages used to set up an ezhuthupally or ashan pallikoodam with one or two teachers. Students used to go this school from nearby areas and learn languages, literature, mathematics, grammar etc. After completing this students may continue study about specific subjects such as ayurveda, astrology, accounting etc. Censuses during 1800 shows that Travancore, Cochin, Kannur areas have many such schools. Even name list of ashans were used to be published along with the census.\nHistory.\nMedieval era.\nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics was founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala mainly based at \"Vettathunadu\" (present-day Tirur region), which included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559\u20131632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts. Their most important results\u2014series expansion for trigonometric functions\u2014were described in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta called \"Tantrasangraha\", and again in a commentary on this work, called \"Tantrasangraha-vakhya\", of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (c.1500\u20131610), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on Tantrasangraha. Their work, completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe, provided what is now considered the first example of a power series (apart from geometric series). However, they did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.\nModern era.\nBefore that local schools were formed by wealthy families or by teachers known as kudipallikudam where children were taught language/literature, mathematics etc. Tamil and Sanskrit were given special status while Malayalam was not given that respect. Almost all communities had members who were well educated. Artisan/trade/medical communities like Vishwakarma, Ezhava, etc., gave special interest in acquiring education. A cultural revolution happened during the second part of the 19th and first half of 20th century in Kerala and emphasis of education was part of it. Many schools and even ladies hostels were started during this period. This period also saw the popularization of newspapers, magazines etc. Education in Kerala had been promoted during British rule in India as part of their policy and also by Christian missionaries.\n1800-1880.\nBasel Mission.\nIn the 19th century, Kerala underwent transformative changes in its educational landscape, driven largely by missionary activities. The Basel German Evangelical Mission played a pivotal role by establishing schools across the Malabar region. In 1818, the British missionary Rev. J. Dawson initiated the establishment of an English School in Mattancherry with financial aid from the Cochin Government. Dr. Hermann Gundert, associated with the Basel Mission, significantly contributed to Malayalam language and literature by compiling the first Malayalam grammar book, Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam, and preparing the initial Malayalam-English dictionary in 1872. The Basel Mission, under W.T. Ringletaube, made strides in education, setting up schools in Nagercoil and nearby areas between 1806 and 1816.\nHermann Gundert associated with the Basel Mission, played a pivotal role in the 19th-century educational landscape of Kerala. In February 1846, Gundert opened a lithographic press and bookbinding establishment at Nettur near Tellicherry, contributing significantly to the development of education in Malabar. The Basel Mission's printing press published the Malayalam fortnightly magazine \"Keralopakari\" in May 1874, covering world news, weather reports, and agricultural news. Gundert's efforts in introducing sophisticated printing technology and publishing textbooks were instrumental in boosting education in the region. His contribution to Malayalam language and literature remains a lasting legacy in Kerala's educational history.\nChurch Missionary Society and London Missionary Society.\nThe 19th-century educational landscape of Kerala was profoundly shaped by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and the London Missionary Society (LMS). Rev. Mead of LMS, active from 1817 to 1873, played a crucial role by initiating vocational schools in southern Thiruvithamkur. In 1816, Thomas Dawson, the first CMS missionary, opened a school in Mattancherry. CMS missionaries, including Thomas Norton and Henry Baker (husband of Mrs. Dorothea Baker), were instrumental in promoting education for oppressed and lower castes, establishing schools in Mavelikkara, Tiruvalla, Mallapalli, Mundakkayam, and Melukavu. Mrs. Dorothea Baker, wife of Rev. Henry Baker from CMS, launched the first girls' school, Baker Memorial Girls\u2019 School in Kottayam in 1819, marking a historic milestone in female education. CMS's emphasis on education brought about a radical change in the social structure of Kerala, challenging traditional norms. The split between the Syrian church and CMS in 1835-40 led to the founding of the Marthoma Church, which independently established numerous English schools.\nCatholic Church.\nA significant figure in the 19th century was Archbishop Bernardine Baccinelli, who started a system called \"A school along with every church\" to make education available for both poor and rich. That system still continues in the present. His work has resulted in the promotion of education for girls.\nMother Eliswa, a widow turned nun started a school for girls in Kerala.\nIn 1824 Basel Mission was running 56 while CMS managed 47 schools. By the end of the century the schools increased to 257 and 351 respectively.\n1880-1947.\nTravancore rulers.\nUnder reign of the Travancore rulers, Maharaja Visakham Thirunal Rama Varma (1880-1885) and Maharaja MoolamThirunal Rama Varma (1885\u20131924), Kerala experienced a surge in educational advancements. The rulers implemented grants-in-aid to extend elementary education, categorized schools from primary to specialized colleges, and introduced free primary education for backward classes. Maharaja MoolamThirunal Rama Varma's reign saw the establishment of various educational institutions, including the Victoria Medical School, a Normal School for girls, and the Sanskrit College. Reformatory schools for juvenile offenders were established, and technical education was encouraged with the institution of scholarships for studies in European countries.\nMajor leaders.\nChristian organizations played a significant role in channeling substantial investments into educational institutions during this era. However, these endeavors resulted in tensions with other communities in terms of accessibility, impeding the monopoly on education. However, such conflicts made other religious organizations to reconsider their involvement in the education sector. Prominent among these entities were Nair Service Samajam (NSS), Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam), and the Muslim Education Society (MES). The level of government support for these organizations fluctuated over time, reflecting a noteworthy evolution in the government's perspective on these developments over the years. The establishment of Karukachal English School in 1915 marked entry of NSS into the field of education. The major leaders in the education field at that time were Catholic churches, Nair Service Society, SNDP Yogam, Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sabha, Muslim Education Society (MES) and a few individuals.\nPost Independence era.\nThe Kerala Education Act of 1958 provided for the better organization and development of educational institutions. According to the first economic census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within , 98.6% had a middle school within and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within . In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as completely literate, although the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%.\nPresent.\nSchools and colleges are mostly run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the Kerala Board of Public Examination (KBPE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), or the (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most private schools, while government run schools offer English or Malayalam as the medium of instruction. Government-run schools in the districts bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also offer instruction in Kannada or Tamil languages. A handful of Government Sanskrit Schools provide instruction in Sanskrit supplemented by Malayalam, English, Tamil or Kannada. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School in one of the three streams\u2014liberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes. Kerala topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in year 2006\u20132007. In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam. Around 18% of the total employees in the organised sector of state, both public and private, are employed in the Educational sector as in March 2020. Kerala is also one of the Indian states which spend a larger proportion of its revenue for human resource development including educational and healthcare uplifting.Also it is mostly literate\nIn 2006\u20132007, the state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) of the 21 major states in India. , enrolment in elementary education was almost 100%; and, unlike other states in India, educational opportunity was almost equally distributed among sexes, social groups, and regions. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has a 93.9% literacy, compared to the national literacy rate of 74.0%.\nIn January 2016, Kerala became the first Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its \"Athulyam\" literacy programme. Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala, according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004\u20132005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.\nStructure and educational authority.\nThe schools and colleges in Kerala are run by the government or private trusts and individuals.All the schools in Kerala are under the administrative control of General Education Department and under which the Directorate of General Education is the biggest administrative umbrella. The Director of General Education (erstwhile Director of Public Instruction) is the administrative head of the school administration. Majority of public schools are affiliated with the SCERT Kerala. There are 15,892 schools affiliated to SCERT, of which 5,986 are government schools, 8,183 are aided schools, and the rest are either un-aided or technical schools. Each school is affiliated with either the State Council of Educational Research and Training, Kerala (SCERT Kerala), Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), or the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), though some schools in the state do offer Cambridge International Examination's IGCSE curriculum. English is the language of instruction in most private schools, but government-run schools offer both English and Malayalam as medium. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at Higher Secondary School in one of the three streams\u2014humanities, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programs. There are also a lot of private educational and training institutes, career colleges, etc. that run with and without regulation of a authorizing body, and many with authorizing body names that sound similar to a government related accrediting body like \"Rural Allied Healthcare Skill Council Of India\" or of reputable universities to deceive students into believing programs run by them are accredited and recognized. Major differentiating characteristic of these programs are that they are not recognized for further academic pursuits. Many programs that are provided through parallel accrediting bodies like Bharat Sevak Samaj (BSS), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE), Kerala State RUTRONIX, etc. are not run with the required integrity, and hence courses taken through such programs are not transferrable. \nGeneral education.\nThe Minister of General Education, who is a member of the state legislature, is in overall charge of school education in the state. The following Directorates implement those education aspects which are under the control of the General Education Department.\nHigher education.\nThe Minister of Higher Education, who is a member of state legislator, is in overall charge of higher education in the state. The Higher Education Department, is the administrative department responsible for higher education, university education and collegiate education in the state.\nMedical education.\nThe Kerala Medical Council (KMC) is responsible for regulating and overseeing medical education in the state. It sets the guidelines and standards for medical colleges, courses, and examinations. The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) is a government body responsible for overseeing medical education in the state of Kerala, India. The DME functions under the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala. The primary responsibility of the Directorate of Medical Education is to regulate and supervise the functioning of medical colleges, dental colleges, nursing schools, and other allied health institutions in Kerala. Some of the renowned medical colleges in Kerala include Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram; Calicut Medical College, Kozhikode; Government Medical College, Manjeri; Government Medical College, Pathanamthitta, among others.\nFisheries.\nKerala has a dedicated fisheries university known as Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS). Established in 2010, KUFOS is the first fisheries university in India. It offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in fisheries science, aquaculture, fishery biology, fishing technology, and related disciplines. The Department of Fisheries is in overall charge of fisheries education in the state.\nVeterinary.\nThe Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development, is in overall charge of development and administration of fisheries institutions in the state.\nKerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) is a state university dedicated to veterinary and animal sciences. It is headquartered in Pookode, Wayanad.\nSchool education in Kerala.\nThere are many Government agencies which support the quality of school education in Kerala.The Directorate of General Education is the topmost administrative wing of School Education. The other agencies are SCERT (State Council for Educational Research and Training), SSK (Samagra Shiksha Kerala), Kite, SIEMAT (State Institute for Educational management and Training), SIET (State Institute for Educational Technology). The KITE Kerala is a state owned special purpose company under education department of the Government of Kerala. It was developed to support ICT enabled education for schools in the state. The erstwhile IT@School Project was transformed into KITE for extending its scope of operations in August 2017. Kerala is the first Indian state to have ICT-enabled education with hi-tech classrooms in all public schools. Kerala topped in the \"School Education Quality Index\" published by NITI Aayog in 2019.\nAccording to a 1999 study by the Centre for Socio-economic &amp; Environmental Studies, dropout rates in primary schools were significantly low. However, the study found that dropout rates increased notably in the ninth and tenth grades in Kerala. This was particularly true of SC/ST students. Schools showed that only 73% of the students joining at 1st Standard reach the 10th Standard. In the case of scheduled caste students, only 59% reached the 10th standard. 60% of Scheduled Tribe students drop out by the 10th standard. In March 2011, 91.37% students qualified for higher studies in the matriculation Examination. The grades in SSLC examination plays an important role in the admission procedure to colleges in Kerala.\nIn Kerala, school education is divided into three stages, viz.,\nVocational higher secondary education (VHSE).\nVHSE offers job-oriented courses to students at the higher secondary level (11th and 12th grades) and aims to provide them with practical skills and training for employment. The VHSE courses are designed to equip students with specific vocational skills in various fields such as agriculture, commerce, engineering, health sciences, humanities, and technology. These courses are intended to prepare students for immediate employment after completing their higher secondary education.\nHigher education in Kerala.\nThe Department of Higher Education is responsible for the overall governance and development of higher education in the state. It formulates policies, plans, and implements programs related to higher education.\nSpecialized institutions.\nSpecialized institutions of higher education specializes in fields such as engineering, medicine, agriculture, architecture, and pharmacy. Some notable institutions in this cateory include the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Kozhikode, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Calicut, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Mangalapuram, and College of Engineering, Trivandrum.\nUniversities.\nKerala has several universities that offer undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs across various disciplines. Some of the prominent universities in the state include:\nGovernment and private colleges.\nKerala has numerous government and private colleges affiliated with universities. College level education started in 1860s, however the first university was established in 1937. These colleges offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses in arts, science, commerce, engineering, medicine, law, management, and other disciplines.\nAutonomous colleges.\nThere are several autonomous colleges in Kerala that have the freedom to design their own curriculum, conduct examinations, and award degrees. These colleges often have a reputation for academic excellence and offer a variety of courses.\nPolytechnic colleges.\nKerala has a network of polytechnic colleges that offer diploma and certificate courses in engineering, technology, and allied disciplines. These colleges focus on practical and technical education.\nStudent immigration and brain drain.\nFrom the mid-2000s onward, there has been a trend of students migrating from Kerala to other states due to a lack of accessibility and quality of education. Since the mid-2010s, a trend of students migrating from Kerala to other countries for studies with the aim of permanent immigration has been observed. This trend began to change in 2020, as students who complete their Plus Two or school education started migrating for studies. This shift is found to be driven by the lack of international recognition of Kerala's higher educational qualifications as equivalent and the limited availability of quality job opportunities within Kerala. This has become prevalent due to the deteriorating social and polieconomical state of the country, lack of opportunity to make sustainable living, and lack of state's ability to be inclusive of needs of families and individuals of all socioeconomic status and ability to innovate and capture trends of modern higher education that meets it's populations needs. Additionally, the rise of unregulated and predatory study abroad agencies that have mushroomed in every major town's and cities offering qualitative and competent benefits that are often untrue exacerbates the situation. For more than half a century, educated nurses and IT professionals were the regular sources of immigrants. However, the changes in demand for skilled workers in this sector have altered the situation. Nurses with just one year of experience can now permanently migrate to foreign countries. Similarly, computer science engineers are drawn to the workforce requirements of expanding contract companies in other states, as well as the lifestyle opportunities available in such areas. Those who are unable to achieve these milestones are opting to study abroad to re-educate in their fields, improve their chances, and to avoid in an extend of being in the growing opo sedae generation in Kerala. In 2021, it was estimated that around 30,000 Keralite students annually migrate from India alone for higher education. The number of Keralites immigrating to foreign countries is also significant. Studies have found that most of the students are not migrating for quality education, they are choosing education from parallel colleges and state-accredited colleges in these foreign countries with the purpose of permanently immigrating there. Kerala is planning to bring changes in higher education to attract and retain students who pass higher secondary schools and immigrate as it has a deleterious effect on the income of the state's educational institutions and achieving national growth. Among these changes, the state plans to primarily relax its entry baseline for programs to 50% and the required minimum passing percentage from programs to 60%, ensuring that everyone is considered and given chances to achieve a better life through education. These adjustments aim to realign social design patterns and address counterproductive systems by aligning with the humanistic and self-expanding values of Keralites through meaningful nudges. They also plan to remove traditional cross-entry restrictions to higher education programs, enabling students to capture job sectors they can, and to restructure and match their program curriculum's and evaluation processes to popular study-abroad locations for increasing both opportunity and student caliber by international standards. Additionally, they aim to create internationally standardized (i.e., equating credits or credit hours and syllabi) accelerated bachelor's programs and short master's programs in professional education sectors to attract foreign investors looking for availability of quality manpower, develop industry-related and modern programs with modern educational delivery structures for widening student population (K-Reap), and to regulate predatory study-abroad agencies and their advertisements. Kerala also aims to create emerging programs that can attract students to stay and pursue studies and find qualitative careers in Kerala, give opportunity to start working while studying through MOUs, reduce class sizes, increase student well-being comforts and services, and provide training to professors to increase competency in delivering educational services. The government stated that the overall objective of these changes is to improve citizens' potential for better lifetime earnings and to provide realistic agency in a globalized labor market, benefiting both individuals and the nation as a whole.\nHigher education by region.\nThiruvananthapuram.\nThiruvananthapuram, the state's major academic hub, University of Kerala and several professional education colleges, including 15 engineering colleges, three medical colleges, three ayurveda colleges, two colleges of homeopathy, six other medical colleges, and several law colleges.

        "title": "Mile End tube station",
        "text": "Mile End is a London Underground station in Mile End, London. It is served by the Hammersmith &amp; City, District and Central lines. This station features a cross-platform interchange in both directions; District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines stop on the inside tracks, and the Central line stops on the outside tracks. It is in Travelcard Zone 2.\nHistory.\nThe station was opened on 2 June 1902 by the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway (W&amp;BR). Electrified services started in 1905. The first services were provided by the District Railway (now the District line); the Metropolitan line followed in 1936 (In 1988 this section of the Metropolitan was renamed the Hammersmith &amp; City line). In 1946, the station was expanded and rebuilt by the Chief Architect of London Underground, Stanley Heaps and his assistant Thomas Bilbow, as part of the Central line eastern extension, with services starting on 4 December 1946. Following nationalisation of the joint venture owners of the W&amp;BR, full ownership of the station passed to London Underground in 1950.\nDuring the development of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the 1980s, it was to be a tram system. The preferred northern option was to run the DLR along Mile End Road towards a terminus at Mile End tube station. However the Stratford route was picked and the system became a light metro instead.\nThe station has undergone renovation in 2007. Metronet, a company in a public\u2013private partnership with Transport for London (TfL), got as far as stripping the station bare before the company collapsed in 2008. After a short changeover period, TfL continued the renovation work.\nOn 5 July 2007, a Central line train was derailed when it hit a roll of fire blanket, which had been blown out of a cross-passage between the two tunnels by the strong crosswinds.\nIn November 2009, part of a plastic barrier broke off from a departing Central line train and struck three commuters. One woman suffered a cut in her forehead, and London Underground Ltd faced a fine of up to \u00a320,000 after admitting liability in the case.\nDesign and layout.\nMile End is the only station in a tunnel on the network that offers cross-platform interchange between deep tube (Central line) and sub-surface (District and Hammersmith &amp; City line) trains. The station takes its name from the A11 Mile End Road, which itself is named after a milestone signifying the point east of the boundary of the City of London. However, the stone's position was actually closer to Stepney Green than Mile End station itself, which is further east, on the junction with Burdett Road.\nNotable local places.\nThe station is close to Victoria Park and Mile End Park, as well as the Regent's Canal. Queen Mary University of London, Mile End Hospital and the now-closed St. Clements Hospital\u2014part of the Royal London Hospital\u2014are nearby.\nConnections.\nThe station is served by London Buses daytime and night routes."

        "title": "Random assignment",
        "text": "Random assignment or random placement is an experimental technique for assigning human participants or animal subjects to different groups in an experiment (e.g., a treatment group versus a control group) using randomization, such as by a chance procedure (e.g., flipping a coin) or a random number generator. This ensures that each participant or subject has an equal chance of being placed in any group. Random assignment of participants helps to ensure that any differences between and within the groups are not systematic at the outset of the experiment. Thus, any differences between groups recorded at the end of the experiment can be more confidently attributed to the experimental procedures or treatment.\nRandom assignment, blinding, and controlling are key aspects of the design of experiments because they help ensure that the results are not spurious or deceptive via confounding. This is why randomized controlled trials are vital in clinical research, especially ones that can be double-blinded and placebo-controlled.\nMathematically, there are distinctions between randomization, pseudorandomization, and quasirandomization, as well as between random number generators and pseudorandom number generators. How much these differences matter in experiments (such as clinical trials) is a matter of trial design and statistical rigor, which affect evidence grading. Studies done with pseudo- or quasirandomization are usually given nearly the same weight as those with true randomization but are viewed with a bit more caution.\nBenefits of random assignment.\nImagine an experiment in which the participants are not randomly assigned; perhaps the first 10 people to arrive are assigned to the Experimental group, and the last 10 people to arrive are assigned to the Control group. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter finds differences between the Experimental group and the Control group, and claims these differences are a result of the experimental procedure. However, they also may be due to some other preexisting attribute of the participants, e.g. people who arrive early versus people who arrive late.\nImagine the experimenter instead uses a coin flip to randomly assign participants. If the coin lands heads-up, the participant is assigned to the Experimental group. If the coin lands tails-up, the participant is assigned to the Control group. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter finds differences between the Experimental group and the Control group. Because each participant had an equal chance of being placed in any group, it is unlikely the differences could be attributable to some other preexisting attribute of the participant, e.g. those who arrived on time versus late.\nPotential issues.\nRandom assignment does not guarantee that the groups are matched or equivalent. The groups may still differ on some preexisting attribute due to chance. The use of random assignment cannot eliminate this possibility, but it greatly reduces it.\nTo express this same idea statistically - If a randomly assigned group is compared to the mean it may be discovered that they differ, even though they were assigned from the same group. If a test of statistical significance is applied to randomly assigned groups to test the difference between sample means against the null hypothesis that they are equal to the same population mean (i.e., population mean of differences = 0), given the probability distribution, the null hypothesis will sometimes be \"rejected,\" that is, deemed not plausible. That is, the groups will be sufficiently different on the variable tested to conclude statistically that they did not come from the same population, even though, procedurally, they were assigned from the same total group. For example, using random assignment may create an assignment to groups that has 20 blue-eyed people and 5 brown-eyed people in one group. This is a rare event under random assignment, but it could happen, and when it does it might add some doubt to the causal agent in the experimental hypothesis.\nRandom sampling.\nRandom sampling is a related, but distinct, process. Random sampling is recruiting participants in a way that they represent a larger population. Because most basic statistical tests require the hypothesis of an independent randomly sampled population, random assignment is the desired assignment method because it provides control for all attributes of the members of the samples\u2014in contrast to matching on only one or more variables\u2014and provides the mathematical basis for estimating the likelihood of group equivalence for characteristics one is interested in, both for pretreatment checks on equivalence and the evaluation of post treatment results using inferential statistics. More advanced statistical modeling can be used to adapt the inference to the sampling method.\nHistory.\nRandomization was emphasized in the theory of statistical inference of Charles S. Peirce in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). Peirce applied randomization in the Peirce-Jastrow experiment on weight perception.\nCharles S. Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights.\nPeirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the eighteen-hundreds.\nJerzy Neyman advocated randomization in survey sampling (1934) and in experiments (1923). Ronald A. Fisher advocated randomization in his book on experimental design (1935)."

        "text": "State Route 302 (SR 302) is a north-south (physically southeast-northwest) state highway in northeast Ohio, a U.S. state. State Route 302 has its southern terminus at a signalized intersection with State Route 83 in the city of Wooster. The northern terminus of the highway is at a T-intersection with the concurrency of U.S. Route 250 and State Route 60 in the village of Savannah.\nRoute description.\nAlong its way, State Route 302 travels through portions of Wayne and Ashland Counties. There is no part of this highway that is included within the National Highway System, a network of routes deemed most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense.\nHistory.\nState Route 302 was designated in 1932. When it was established, State Route 302 was a spur route that started at its present intersection with Silver Road west of Wooster. At the time, U.S. Route 250 entered this intersection from the west along Silver Road, and departed to the southeast along present State Route 302. From there, State Route 302 ran along its present alignment northwest to the hamlet of Lattasburg, where it came to an end at its intersection with what is today the eastern terminus of State Route 301. In 1932, the intersecting roadway in Lattasburg was not a state route. Three years after its inception, State Route 302 was extended to the northwest along its current alignment to a new western terminus at State Route 89 just south of Polk. Then, in 1937, State Route 302 was extended again to the northwest, this time to its present western terminus at the U.S. Route 250/State Route 60 concurrency in Savannah.\nIn 1938, State Route 302 was extended on the eastern end. When U.S. Route 250 was re-routed to join U.S. Route 30 further west of Wooster in the hamlet of Jefferson via County Road 157, State Route 302 was extended to the southeast to a new terminus at its present intersection with Old Lincoln Way just west of the Wooster city limits. Then, Old Lincoln Way was the routing of the concurrency of U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 250. By 1964, a new southern bypass of Wooster opened, with U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 250 re-routed onto this new routing. Consequently, State Route 302 was extended to the east into downtown Wooster, where its new endpoint would be at the highway's present intersection with Market Street, which at the time was a part of State Route 76, the predecessor to today's State Route 83. When the eastern freeway bypass of Wooster was extended south of the city's southern bypass in 1981 to link in directly with two-lane U.S. Route 250, State Route 83 was extended east along the former routing of U.S. Route 250 to the eastern bypass, where it then linked up with the U.S. highway heading north. Consequently, State Route 302 was then extended south over the former routing of State Route 83 from downtown Wooster south to its present eastern terminus, where State Route 83 re-joined its former alignment."

        "title": "University of Aveiro",
        "text": "The University of Aveiro () is a public university, in addition to providing polytechnic education, located in the Portuguese city of Aveiro. Founded in 1973, it has a student population of approximately 12,500, distributed among 58 graduate, 40 Masters of Science and 25 PhD programs, distributed by departments and autonomous sections, with specialized faculties. It is a Research &amp; Development university, with research departments developing programmes in fundamental and applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, telecommunications, robotics, bioinformatics, sea sciences, materials, design, business administration and industrial engineering.\nThe main campus and nearby Administration and Accounting Institute, are located in the city centre of Aveiro. There are external/regional campuses in \u00c1gueda (Higher Education Technological and Management School of \u00c1gueda) and Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is (Higher Education School of North Aveiro). It serves as a pole for the inter-university Doctoral program, along with the universities of Porto and Minho. Its integrated Masters in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering was the first Portuguese IT oriented European Accredited Engineering Masters (EUR-ACE) by the European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education.\nHistory.\nOn 15 December 1973, at the inaugural speech of Professor Jos\u00e9 Veiga Sim\u00e3o, then Minister of National Education () the new rector, stated:\nAnnounced in a speech at the Museum of Aveiro, the event was held to mark the first meeting of the commission establishing the University of Aveiro, that included Jos\u00e9 Sim\u00e3o and other members of academic society and Aveiro. The first pedagogical and scientific activities began in 1974, with first days classes in the telecommunication course, comprising 46 students.\nThe licentiate courses established at the University of Aveiro (UA) were the first courses in innovative areas, that were not explored by traditional universities at the time in Portugal, but important to regional or national initiatives. By 1976 there were courses in environmental science and education, natural sciences and education, mathematics and education, Portuguese-English and education and Portuguese-French and education. The student population included 338. It was only in that year that the first infrastructure were established in the area later known as the University Campus of Santigao ().\nDuring the 1977\u20131978 lecture year, there was a proposal to create a pilot project: the first \"Centro Integrado de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Professores\" (CIFOP), today the Integrated Unit for Continuing Education (), in the country. At UA, the intention was to establish a training institute for professors/teachers, from infant education to secondary school, using the latest pedagogical resources and innovative methods. The project was headed by Professor Jo\u00e3o Evangelista Loureiro, the former vice-rector at UA.\nA period of consolidation occurred at the university in the 1980s, resulting in internal regulation and the creation of fundamental bodies (during the mandate of the second rector Dr. Jos\u00e9 Mesquita Rodrigues) as well as the conclusion of the purchase of lands for the campus, later completed during the mandate of Dr. Renato Ara\u00fajo. By the end of the 1980s (specifically 24 September 1988), the law for university autonomy, permitted the consolidation of the university organic laws, and homologation of the university statutes, in June 1989. Meanwhile, a team coordinated by architect Nuno Portas, had begun selecting among various prestigious Portuguese architects in 1986 to design the Santigao University Campus, that fell in line with their attempt to harmonize the structures with the architectural heritage of the city. Many of the buildings, therefore, were designed by internationally recognized architects, among them: Alcino Soutinho, \u00c1lvaro Sisa Vieira, Pedro Ramalho, Lu\u00eds Ramalho, Jos\u00e9 Maria Lopo Prata, Eduardo Souto Moura, Adalberto Dias, Rebello de Andrade, Jorge Kol de Carvalho, Gon\u00e7alo Byrne and Figueiredo Dias, whose works have annually been visited by national and international specialists. By the mid-1980s teaching had expanded with innovative courses in Environment, Industrial Management, Music, Tourism, Chemical Industry and New Technologies.\nThe 1990s was marked by a new phase at UA, with priorities redefined to position the university towards internationalization and cooperation, namely European programs, reinforcing relationships with Portuguese-speaking and Latin states, and building protocols between international institutes, organs and companies abroad. In parallel there were initiatives in continuing education, distance learning and improving student satisfaction and quality. In 1994, an Internet search engine, SAPO, was created in this university. Since 1998, the university has been developing an ecological motor vehicle, \u00cdcaro, aiming to run the largest distance with the smallest amount of consumed fuel, having participated in the international competition Shell Eco-marathon.\nDuring the second mandate of the fourth rector, Dr. J\u00falio Pedrosa, the student population was 8000, and the university had the most number of internationally recognized programs. During 25th anniversary celebrations, UA advanced with the integration of polytechnical study into early training programs. The creation of the Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gest\u00e3o de \u00c1gueda (in 1997), the integration of the Instituto de Contabilidade e Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de Aveiro (in 1999), the implementation of the Escola Superior de Sa\u00fade (in 2000), and the implementation of a polytechnical school in the northern district, the Escola Superior Aveiro-Norte], was part of this process of integration. In 2012\u201313, it was ranked 351\u2013400 in the \"Times Higher Education\" World University rankings. Rankings\nThe first mandate of its sixth rector, Dr. Maria Helena Nazar\u00e9, was marked by the start of professional program in technology (2002\u20132003). Since 2009, it has hosted a SexLab aimed at studying sexual health.\nIn February 2010 Professor Manuel Ant\u00f3nio de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o took charge as the seventh rector, a position held for two mandates until May 2018. During this time he promoted the establishment of the F\u00e1brica \u2013 Centro de Ci\u00eancia Viva de Aveiro.\nOn 8 May 2018 Dr. Paulo Jorge Ferreira took office as the eight rector.\nCulture.\nThe university hosts \"3810-UA\", a weekly national public television program.\nIn mid-spring, a one-week break from formal studies is allowed, wherein anyone may participate in academic activities, concerts or Enterro do Ano, a local academic parade.\nThe university is a regular participant or organizer of robotics inter-university or inter-school competitions, i.e.: Micro-Rato (hardware robotics) and Cyber-Rato (behavioral software). In 2008, one of its teams won the Robocup world competition, in China.\nThe university occasionally organizes mathematics competitions, mostly aimed at pre-university level students.\nUniversity Campus Santiago.\nThe university architecture is modern, with more than 25 buildings.\nAs an organization, the university is composed of departments (one of them built by Eduardo Souto de Moura), autonomous sections, research units, administrative and service facilities, a library (built by \u00c1lvaro Siza), a mediateque, a field track, a multisports building with gym, a residential complex, green spaces, ecological spots and parking lots. The rectory (built by Gon\u00e7alo Byrne) is located in a white building near the campus centre.\nThe campus also has an entire Administration and Accounting Institute, which has its own service facilities and parking lots.\nResearch.\nThe projects developed by UA are developed under 20 research centres, of many different scientific areas:\nAs a research-led institution, during 2015, 316 research and technology transfer projects were active in UA. 80 of these projects are/were funded by International and European Programmes, of which 27 by the 7th Framework Programme, 13 by the Horizon 2020 and 17 by the ERASMUS +."

        "title": "Frontier gambler",
        "text": "The frontier gambler is one of the most recognizable stock characters of the 19th century American frontier. Historically, gamblers were of both sexes, came from a variety of professions and class and geographical backgrounds, were of many different nationalities, and were part of a well-respected profession. As the west became increasingly populated and domesticated, the public perception of gambling changed to a negative one and led nearly all of the state and territorial legislatures to pass anti-gambling laws in and effort to \"clean up\" their towns. The gambler continues to be a captivating figure in the imagery of the west, representing the openness of its society and invoking its association with risk-taking.\nHistory.\nThe heyday of gambling in the West lasted from 1850-1910. Gambling was the number one form of entertainment in the west and nearly everyone living there engaged in it at one time or another. Cowboys, miners, lumberjacks, businessmen, and lawmen all played games of chance for pleasure and profit. Whenever a new settlement or camp started one of the first buildings or tents erected would be a gambling hall. As the settlement grew, these halls would become larger and more elaborate in proportion. Gambling halls were typically the largest and most ornately decorated buildings in any town and often housed a bar, stage for entertainment, and hotel rooms for guests. These establishments were a driving force behind the local economy and many towns measured their prosperity by the number of gambling halls and professional gamblers they had. Towns that were friendly to gambling were typically known to sports as \"wide-awake\" or \"wide-open\" for their acceptance of gambling.\nMost western citizens considered gambling to be a respectable profession and those who chose to make a living doing it, were respected members of society. \n\"Gambling was not only the principal and best paying industry of the town at the time, but it was also reckoned among its most respectable,\" wrote Bat Masterson in 1907.\nProfessional gamblers ran their own games by renting a table at a gambling house and banking it with their own money. Because of this, many professional gamblers settled in one place. In order to be successful as an established businessman, a gambler needed to cultivate a reputation for fairness and running a straight game. These men were known as 'sports'. They did not drink, cheat, or swear. They paid rent and licensing fees, encouraged customers to run up bar tabs and did their best to act as, Historian Hubert Hoover Bancroft put it, \"Reputable and respectable merchants.\" \nBancroft distinguishes between three types of professional gamblers: the 'free-floating professional', the 'established legit' and the 'recreational gentleman'.\nThe California Gold Rush of 1849 created one of the largest draws for migrant gamblers and San Francisco soon became the gambling hotspot of the west. Famous gambling houses included the Parker House, Samuel Dennison's Exchange, and the El Dorado Gambling Saloon. Portsmouth Square was famous for the many houses that clustered closely around it. \nGambling was also popular in the many mining camps throughout California and the southwest. Gambling was so closely associated with the Gold Rush that the overland route to California that passed through Panama became known as the \"Gambler's Route.\" Dealers lay in wait everywhere, and it is said that many an expedition to the gold fields ended in camp before it even began. Mining towns outside of California developed large-scale gambling as well. Deadwood, Silver City, and Tombstone were all as well known for their many gambling halls and saloons as they were for their rich mineral deposits.\nCattle towns in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska became centers of gambling as well. Thanks to the railroad and cattle industries, a great number of people worked in and around these towns and had plenty of money to wager. Abilene, Dodge City, Wichita, Omaha, and Kansas City all had an atmosphere that was convivial to gaming. Not surprisingly, such an atmosphere also invited trouble and such towns also developed reputations as lawless and dangerous places.\nWomen gamblers.\nMen were not the only ones who played at games of chance. Women placed their bets as well and the sight of petticoats at the table was normal. Many women played, dealt or ran their own houses. This choice of profession offered them the opportunity to attain monetary independence and social stature. One of the most famous was Eleanore Dumont, known more crudely in her later years as \"Madame Mustache.\" Miss Dumont ran several different houses throughout her career in Nevada, Idaho, Montana, and South Dakota. Another, Alice Ives, started gambling after the death of her husband. Known more popularly as Poker Alice, she was a popularly recognized figure in the west for her nearly forty-year-long career. Kitty LeRoy made use of her sex appeal and flamboyant personality as well as great gambling ability to become a force of nature in Deadwood. She had multiple husbands and did not hesitate to get rid of men once she tired of them. Perhaps they were lucky because Kitty also had a reputation for shooting men as well.\nRace.\nMany nationalities and races were represented by frontier gamblers. Especially in California during the gold rush, prospectors came from all over the world in search of gold and naturally played games of chance. This included Mexicans, Chinese, Australians, and Peruvians. Anglo migrants to areas of the southwest with pre-established Mexican populations discovered gambling there waiting for them. Most towns had at least one or two gambling houses. One of the most popular games, Monte, originated in Mexico and was adopted and later modified into three card monte. The Chinese were avid gamblers who brought a variety of games with them to North America, including Fan Tan and several different lottery variants. Chinatown in San Francisco contained a great number of gambling houses and was a popular destination for those seeking to play.\nGames.\nGamblers preferred fast-paced games allowed them an opportunity to turn a profit quickly. Faro was the most popular game of the time and was known as the \"King of all games.\" It was not the only game people played, and monte, Vingt-et-Un (twenty-one), roulette, chuck-a-luck were all popular ways to take a risk. Poker was not initially popular because of its slow pace but gradually increased in popularity as time went on. Not all games required playing cards. Dice games such as craps were common as were games involving a wheeled device, such as roulette or hazard. Saloons and gaming tables were not the only places to bet however, and westerners had a well-deserved reputation of being willing to bet on anything. Horse races became an enormously popular means of wagering, and foot races and boxing matches provided a similar opportunity. Fights between animals were popular as well; cockfighting, dogfights, or even a panther vs. bear battle.\nIn popular culture.\nThe popular stereotype of the frontier gambler presents a tall, thin male wearing a mustache. He is well groomed and wears a tailored suit, usually of black. Usually having a southern background, the frontier gambler is presented as a gentlemen in manner and custom and is concerned with maintaining his honor. The gambler possesses a calm demeanor and is cool under pressure, but when crossed instantly becomes a cold-blooded killer.\nGambling and gamblers are featured in many, many western books, movies, and TV programs and this high occurrence reflects the ubiquity of the activity in western society. The high frequency of these scenes reveal the close association between the west and gambling that continues today, an association just as strong as that of the west with cowboys or lawmen. Gambling is a convenient plot device; it may be used in the background, a setting for character discussion, or the motivation behind the plot. For example, scenes depicting high-stakes card games or gunfights over those games are so common as to be clich\u00e9.\nThe persistent presence of gambling in western mythology shows a strong association with the risk-taking and chance that were involved both in coming to the west and in everyday life there. In a sense, those who chose to leave their lives and come west were taking a huge gamble just to begin with. Gambling is also strongly associated with extralegal activity and to have that activity practiced so frequently suggests a popular association of the west with a state of lax legal and moral codes."

        "text": "The Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (, abbreviated as PPKI, ) was a body established on 7 August 1945 to prepare for the transfer of authority from the occupying Japanese to Indonesia. It approved and promulgated the first Indonesian constitution, and appointed Sukarno president.\nBackground.\nIn two sessions from May to July 1945, the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) decided on Pancasila as the ideological basis of independent Indonesia, and produced a draft constitution. With the war turning against them, the Japanese, who were occupying Indonesia, decided to grant independence in order to create problems for the returning Dutch colonial authorities. The plan was that Java would become independent in early September, followed shortly by the rest of the country. On 7 August, the day after an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Lt. General Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Japanese Southern Area who was based in Saigon, gave permission for the formation of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI).\nOn 9 August, the day of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, the Japanese authorities flew future president Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and BPUPK chairman Radjiman Wediodiningrat to Da Lat, French Indochina for a meeting with General Hisaichi Terauchi, the commander of the Southern Area. He promised Indonesian independence would be granted on 24 August, and appointed Sukarno chairman of the PPKI. After delaying discussion of the extent of independent Indonesia when setting up the BPUPK, the Japanese finally clearly stated it would include the whole of the former Dutch East Indies. The three men flew back to Indonesia, arriving on 14 August. The Indonesian underground rejected any independence gifted by the Japanese, preferring to win it through force of arms. However, on 17 August 1945, two days after the Japanese surrender, Sukarno declared independence.\nMembership.\nMost of the 21 committee members appointed by the Japanese belonged to the older generation. Unlike the BPUPK, whose members only came from Java, the PPKI had representatives from Eastern Indonesia (under the control of the Japanese navy) and Sumatra. The membership comprised:\nAdded later.\nSix additional committee members added without the approval of the Japanese authorities in Indonesia: \nActions of the PPKI.\nThe committee met for the first time on 18 August in the building in Jakarta formerly used by the Council of the Indies. It elected Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice-president of Indonesia. It established a seven-member commission, including Sukarno, Hatta, Soepomo and Muhammad Yamin, to approve the constitution that had been started by the BPUPK in July and to make other changes. One significant change was the removal from the constitution preamble of the obligation for Muslims to abide by Sharia law included in the Jakarta Charter as it was felt this would alienate Christians. The changes took less than a week, and the constitution was published in the 14 February 1946 edition of \"Berita Republik Indonesia\", the government gazette. In the same meeting, the committee also decided that the president would be assisted by a national committee\nOn August 19, the committee met again and divided Indonesia into eight provinces: West, Central and East Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and the Lesser Sundas. In its third and last meeting, held on August 22, the PPKI decided to establish the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP), a state party the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and the Badan Keamanan Rakyat (People's Security Agency) - the forerunner of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.\nThe committee was dissolved by Sukarno on 29 August and replaced by the KNIP."

        "text": ", there were 97,121 battery electric vehicles and 97,071 plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in Denmark, together equivalent to about 7% of all vehicles in the country. , 19.1% of all new cars sold in Denmark were fully electric, and 18.0% were plug-in hybrid.\nIn 2022, Denmark was ranked by Forbes as the third most EV-friendly country in the world.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1980s to early 1990s, a few thousand of the small, one-person and locally produced \"Ellert\" were sold in Denmark, but relatively few remain today. In the following decade, very few electric cars were sold in Denmark, but a clear increase began around 2010.\nUp to and including 2015, electric cars had been exempt from vehicle registration tax, but it was decided that this would be gradually outphased: In 2016, the vehicle registration tax for electric cars was placed at 20% of the normal rate, in 2017 it was planned to increase to 40% and within five years it would become the full rate. This had a large effect on the sale, which drastically fell in 2016\u201317. As a consequence, it was decided that the increase in vehicle registration tax for electric vehicles would be delayed, being capped at 20% of the normal rate in 2017\u201319, then gradually increasing until 2023 where it would become the full rate. A new fund for fuel cell vehicles was also started.\nIn 2020, a new taxation deal was reached, valid for all cars from 2021 to 2030. Its rates depend heavily on the -emission of the car. This means that vehicle registration tax for all-electric cars (BEVs) that cost less than 510,000 DKK (\u20ac68,500) will remain very low with a slower than initially planned gradual increase to normal levels, most plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) will increase from 2021 but remain lower than gasoline and diesel cars, and diesel cars will increase. The goal of this plan is to have at least 775,000 electric cars (BEV or PHEV) by 2030. Combined with other plans, it is the goal to have at least 1 million zero-emission or low-emission cars by 2030 and that no new gasoline or diesel cars will be sold in the country from that year.\nStatistics.\n, 60% of all electric vehicles sold in Denmark were used.\nIn 2015, Denmark was the second largest European market for light-duty, plug-in commercial vehicles or utility vans, with over 2,600 plug-in vans sold that year, representing 8.5% of all vans sold. Most vans were plug-in hybrids, accounting for almost all EU plug-in van sales.\n, the \u0160koda Enyaq was the best-selling electric car in Denmark.\nGovernment policy.\n, Denmark charges a registration tax of 40% for fully electric vehicles, and 50% for plug-in hybrid vehicles.\nCharging stations.\n, there were 4,850 public charging stations in Denmark.\nPublic transportation.\nIn 2020, the municipalities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, Vejle and Frederiksberg announced plans to end purchases of non-electric buses by the end of the year.\nBy region.\nHovedstaden.\n, 53% of new cars sold in the Capital Region of Denmark were electric or plug-in hybrid.\n, there were 1,240 public charging stations in Copenhagen.\nMidtjylland.\n, 1.5% of vehicles in Aarhus were electric.\nSj\u00e6lland.\n, 60% of new cars sold in Region Zealand were electric or plug-in hybrid.\nSyddanmark.\n, there were about 14,000 electric vehicles registered in the Region of Southern Denmark.\n, 61% of new cars sold on Funen were electric or plug-in hybrid."

The premiere took place on 11 May 2015 at the Royal Opera House. It was McGregor's first full-length ballet for The Royal Ballet, and won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production.\nProduction.\nIn the ballet, each act represent one of Woolf's novels. The three acts, titled \"I now, I then\", \"Becomings\" and \"Tuesday\" are inspired by \"Mrs. Dalloway\", \"Orlando\" and \"The Waves\" respectively.\nAlessandra Ferri, who was 52, was invited by McGregor to star in \"Woolf Works\", as he believed her age was suitable for the role. Mara Galeazzi, a former principal dancer who left the company in 2013, was asked to cover for Ferri, though Galeazzi did not perform the role until 2017.\nThe music, composed by McGregor's frequent collaborator Max Richter, featured both classical and electronic sounds. A recording of Woolf reading her essay \"On Craftsmanship\" was used in \"I now, I then.\" Actress Gillian Anderson provided a voice recording of reading Woolf's suicide note, which is played in the beginning of \"Tuesday.\" The music was released as an album titled \"Three Worlds: Music from Woolf Works\".\nA 2017 revival was filmed and relayed in cinemas. The film was later broadcast by BBC 4 and released on a DVD. The Royal Opera House released the recording online in response to the impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts. In the first full company performance since the pandemic started, Edward Watson, Akane Takada and Calvin Richardson performed an excerpt from \"I now, I then.\"\nLa Scala Theatre Ballet in Milan debuted \"Woolf Works\" in 2019. Ferri and Federico Bonelli, a Royal Ballet principal, reprised their roles from the original production."

        "text": "Leigh Woods is a area of woodland on the south-west side of the Avon Gorge, close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, within North Somerset opposite the English city of Bristol and north of the Ashton Court estate, of which it formed a part. Stokeleigh Camp, a hillfort thought to have been occupied from the third century BC to the first century AD and possibly also in the Middle Ages, lies within the reserve on the edge of the Nightingale Valley. On the bank of the Avon, within the reserve, are quarries for limestone and celestine which were worked in the 18th and 19th centuries are now derelict.\nIn 1909 part of the woodland was donated to the National Trust by George Alfred Wills, to prevent development of the city beside the gorge following the building of the Leigh Woods suburb. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by Forestry England. Rare trees include multiple species of \"Sorbus\" with at least nine native and four imported species. Bristol rockcress (\"Arabis scabra\") which is unique to the Avon Gorge can be seen flowering in April; various species of orchids and western spiked speedwell (\"Veronica spicata\") are common in June and July. It is a national nature reserve and is included in the Avon Gorge Site of Special Scientific Interest.\nTopography.\nThe woods, which cover an area of , are on a ridge which mainly consists of limestone, with some sandstone which runs from Clifton to Clevedon, away on the Bristol Channel coast. At the southern end of the woods is Nightingale Valley (one of several thus named in the area), a dry valley which is cut into the side of the gorge. Its area slopes from the highest point nearly opposite the north gate of Ashton Court to the River Avon beside the western buttress of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The woods are on the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath.\nHistory.\nWithin Leigh Woods is Stokeleigh Camp, a hill fort thought to have been occupied from the third century BC to the first century AD and also in the Middle Ages. It is situated on a promontory, bounding the north flank of the Nightingale Valley and occupying around . Stokeleigh Camp is thought to have been occupied from the late pre-Roman Iron Age, when it was in the area controlled by the Dobunni. Archaeological investigations suggest during the 1st century Belgae tribes may have been present with some of the pottery showing the influence of the Durotriges. There may have been a break in occupation before reuse in the middle to late 2nd century. In addition to the pottery recovered a possible coin of Gallienus dating from his reign between 253 and 268 has been recovered. An iron-involuted brooch of the La T\u00e8ne II type has also been found. It is unclear whether the occupation of Stokeleigh Camp in the 3rd century was for a formal garrison or whether it was just used by \"squatters\" or as a place of refuge in times of crisis. Stokeleigh might have been connected with the Wansdyke, a series of defensive linear earthworks, consisting of a ditch and an embankment running at least from Maes Knoll in Somerset, to the Savernake Forest near Marlborough in Wiltshire; however, there is little evidence for this. It is also possible that the site was occupied in the Middle Ages.\nNorth of Stokeleigh Camp are a series of limestone and mineral quarries, overlooking the River Avon, which are now disused. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries this had an important celestine quarry and a tramway which linked it to a dock on the Avon; both are now derelict. The area has in recent years been restored as an arboretum. At the northern end of the woods is Paradise Bottom. This is included in the Leigh Court Estate and was part of the ground laid out by Humphry Repton for Philip John Miles. Some of the first plantings of the giant redwood \"(Sequoiadendron giganteum)\" and the Weymouth pine \"(Pinus strobus)\", among other \"exotics\" imported to the UK, were made here by Sir William Miles in the 1860s.\nTo the south of the woods is an affluent suburb of Bristol also known as Leigh Woods. It is situated at the western end of the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which opened in 1864, making the development of Leigh Woods as an upmarket residential area practicable. Houses in varying styles were built from the mid-1860s until the First World War.\nIn 1857 the mutilated body of a murdered woman was found in Nightingale Valley; the following year, John Beale was hanged at Taunton for the crime in January 1858. Another violent death occurred in 1948 when George Henry Chinnock, who had been living in the woods, was found with head injuries.\nIn 1909 part of the woodland was donated to the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing development on the western side of the gorge as Bristol grew in size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by Forestry England.\nThe Portishead Railway runs close to the river at the bottom of the woods. It was opened on 18 April 1867, but closed on 3 April 1981. The Great Western Railway built a small station with the aim of attracting tourists to the area; was not very successful and was only in use for less than five years, from 9 July 1928 until 12 September 1932. The line was reopened for freight traffic as far as Royal Portbury Dock on 21 December 2001 and local councils are proposing to reintroduce a passenger service to Portishead as part of their MetroWest plans, although this would not happen before 2019.\nIn 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron crashed into Leigh Woods. The pilot, Flying officer John Greenwood, was killed after he flew under the deck of the suspension bridge while performing a victory roll.\nSmall mountain biking circuits are present in the woods and the area is a popular walking and rock climbing area for Bristolians.\nFlora and fauna.\nBecause of the rare flora and fauna, the woods have been included in the Avon Gorge Site of Special Scientific Interest, which received the designation in 1952, and has been designated as a national nature reserve.\nThe south part of the woods is an area of former pasture woodland with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (\"Sorbus bristoliensis\") and wild service tree (\"Sorbus torminalis\"). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, making it one of the most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (\"Corvus\") and peregrine falcon (\"Falco peregrinus\"). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (\"Satyrium w-album\").\nOn the steep grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (\"Arabis scabra\") which is unique to the Avon Gorge can be seen flowering in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (\"Veronica spicata\") are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest \"(Monotropa hypopitys)\". Lady orchid \"(Orchis purpurea)\" was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered helleborine \"(Epipactis phyllanthes)\" is found on the western side of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods."

Majlis Pusat, the umbrella body for Malay cultural groups proposed an idea of a Malay village in the 1970s. The purpose is to showcase Malay culture to visitors and to provide a place for selling Malay souvenirs. The suggested location is Pasir Panjang. In August 1980, Ahmad Mattar, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, announced plans for the village which the then Minister for National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, gives approval in principle in November 1981. The official approval was given by the Government in February 1984 with Geylang as the chosen site.\nThe construction of the village began in 1986 and completed in November 1989 and it costs the HDB $10 million. In 1990, the Malay Cultural Month was held during its opening from 25 February to 24 March. In September 1991, the Ananda group of companies, run by Hong Kong businessman Clarence Cheung, won the tender with a bid of $3.8 million to run the Malay Village. Plans were proposed to build a $10 million high-tech Islamic cultural museum in the village which did not materialise. Tender for the shops were open in 1992 but only eight shops out of 70 were open with seven out of 45 successful bidders pull out. An advisory panel was also formed.\nIn 2006, a new management, Malay Village Pte Ltd, took over the village and makes a police report with regards to the Malay Village's accounts. However the village has already a six-digit debt with insufficient funds to pay it. In 2008, Malay Village Pte Ltd announces plans to revive the place. However, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), in the same year, announced plans to demolish the Malay Village after its lease ends in 2011 and to build a suburban commercial hub which includes a civic centre, a 2,000 sq m open plaza space, commercial developments and a new road. Appeals to the URA by shop tenants, management and Marine Parade GRC's Member of Parliament, Fatimah Lateef, were rejected.\nOn 17 November 2010, an Eid al-Adha ritual, organised by the Inter-racial and religious confidence circle of Kampong Ubi Kembangan and Geylang Serai, was held at the Malay Village. It was the first time the ritual was performed there. The Malay Village was chosen as it was the operation centre of Mini Environment Service, the Government's appointed korban vendor.\nClosure and demolition.\nAfter 23 years of history, the museum was shut down in 26 September 2011. The structure was eventually demolished in 2012 to make way for a new complex known as Wisma Geylang Serai, which was slated to open in May 2018.\nThe Wisma Geylang Serai was officially opened on 26 January 2019 by Lee Hsien Loong, the 3rd Prime Minister of Singapore."

        "text": "Secret Teaching Organization (, \"TON\" also translated as the \"Secret Teaching Society\" or \"Clandestine Teaching Organization\") was an underground Polish educational organization created in 1939 after the German invasion of Poland to provide underground education in occupied Poland during World War II.\nThe Organization was created towards the end of October 1939 in Warsaw response to German closure of most Polish educational institutions and repressions against teachers. To forestall the rise of a new generation of educated Poles, German officials decreed that Polish children's schooling should end after a few years of elementary education. Heinrich Himmler wrote in a May 1940 memorandum, \"The sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic, nothing above the number\u00a0500; writing one's name; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the Germans... I do not think that a knowledge of reading is desirable.\" Most schools were closed, many teachers were arrested and even executed during the purges of Polish intelligentsia, in the remaining schools, curriculum was heavily censored, textbooks were confiscated, libraries closed.\nThe Organization concentrated on the primary education. Over time, it expanded into secondary education. It provided assistance to teachers in need, for example to the ones deported from the Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany, or to the ones in hiding with arrest warrants. It provided assistance to the families of teachers who had been imprisoned or killed, or who were in hiding. It was also involved in the underground printing and distribution of textbooks.\nNorman Davies notes that the Organization undertook the education of a million children. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in the Organization underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people and the university level courses, about 10,000.\nThe Organization cooperated closely with the Polish government in exile (by which it was subsidized) and the Polish Underground State. Its network covered the whole of Poland, roughly corresponding to the pre-war educational structure of the Second Polish Republic, and was most organized in the General Government. Thousands of its members were arrested and killed by the Germans. It is estimated that about 15% of Polish teachers or 8,000 died during the occupation period.\nFounders and main activists of the Organization, many of whom were connected to the pre-war Association of Polish Teachers (\"Zwi\u0105zek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego\"), included: Zygmunt Nowicki, Kazimierz Maj, Wac\u0142aw Tu\u0142odziecki, Teofil Woje\u0144ski and Czes\u0142aw Wycech.\nIn 1945 the Organization became the basis of the reestablished Association of Polish Teachers; however, it also became controlled by the Soviet-installed communist government."

In its summary observations on the attack, the Ad Hoc Commission observed that the attack was clearly premeditated and well organised, as indicated by the following:\nALRC opinion.\nThe Asian Legal Resource Centre is of the opinion that the massacre at Depayin clearly amounts to a \"widespread or systematic attack directed against [a] civilian population, with a knowledge of the attack\" (article 7.1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court) and is therefore a crime against humanity. To date, however, there has been no serious action taken on the massacre."

        "text": "Cessna () is an American brand of general aviation aircraft owned by Textron Aviation since 2014, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Originally, it was a brand of the Cessna Aircraft Company, an American general aviation aircraft manufacturing corporation also headquartered in Wichita. The company produced small, piston-powered aircraft, as well as business jets. For much of the mid-to-late 20th century, Cessna was one of the highest-volume and most diverse producers of general aviation aircraft in the world. It was founded in 1927 by Clyde Cessna and Victor Roos and was purchased by General Dynamics in 1985, then by Textron, Inc. in 1992. In March 2014, when Textron purchased the Beechcraft and Hawker Aircraft corporations, Cessna ceased operations as a subsidiary company, and joined the others as one of the three distinct brands produced by Textron Aviation.\nThroughout its history, and especially in the years following World War II, Cessna became best-known for producing high-wing, small piston aircraft. Its most popular and iconic aircraft is the Cessna 172, delivered since 1956 (with a break from 1986\u20131996), with more sold than any other aircraft in history. Since the first model was delivered in 1972, the brand has also been well known for its Citation family of low-wing business jets which vary in size.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nClyde Cessna, a farmer in Rago, Kansas, built his own aircraft and flew it in June 1911. He was the first person to do so between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Cessna started his wood-and-fabric aircraft ventures in Enid, Oklahoma, testing many of his early planes on the salt flats. When bankers in Enid refused to lend him more money to build his planes, he moved to Wichita.\nCessna Aircraft was formed when Clyde Cessna and Victor Roos became partners in the Cessna-Roos Aircraft Company in 1927. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna. Shortly afterward, Roos's name was dropped from the company name.\nThe Cessna DC-6 earned certification on the same day as the stock market crash of 1929, October 29, 1929.\nIn 1932, the Cessna Aircraft Company closed due to the Great Depression.\nHowever, the Cessna CR-3 custom racer made its first flight in 1933. The plane won the 1933 American Air Race in Chicago and later set a new world speed record for engines smaller than 500 cubic inches by averaging .\nCessna's nephews, brothers Dwane and Dwight Wallace, bought the company from Cessna in 1934. They reopened it and began the process of building it into what would become a global success.\nThe Cessna C-37 was introduced in 1937 as Cessna's first seaplane when equipped with Edo floats. In 1940, Cessna received their largest order to date, when they signed a contract with the U.S. Army for 33 specially equipped Cessna T-50s, their first twin engine plane. Later in 1940, the Royal Canadian Air Force placed an order for 180 T-50s.\nPostwar boom.\nCessna returned to commercial production in 1946, after the revocation of wartime production restrictions (L-48), with the release of the Model 120 and Model 140. The approach was to introduce a new line of all-metal aircraft that used production tools, dies and jigs, rather than the hand-built tube-and-fabric construction process used before the war.\nThe Model 140 was named by the US Flight Instructors Association as the \"Outstanding Plane of the Year\" in 1948.\nCessna's first helicopter, the Cessna CH-1, received FAA type certification in 1955.\nCessna introduced the Cessna 172 in 1956. It became the most produced airplane in history. During the post-World War II era, Cessna was known as one of the \"Big Three\" in general aviation aircraft manufacturing, along with Piper and Beechcraft.\nIn 1959, Cessna acquired Aircraft Radio Corporation (ARC), of Boonton, New Jersey, a leading manufacturer of aircraft radios. During these years, Cessna expanded the ARC product line, and rebranded ARC radios as \"Cessna\" radios, making them the \"factory option\" for avionics in new Cessnas. However, during this time, ARC radios suffered a severe decline in quality and popularity. Cessna kept ARC as a subsidiary until 1983, selling it to avionics-maker Sperry.\nIn 1960, Cessna acquired McCauley Industrial Corporation, of Ohio, a leading manufacturer of propellers for light aircraft. McCauley became the world's leading producer of general aviation aircraft propellers, largely through their installation on Cessna airplanes.\nIn 1960, Cessna affiliated itself with Reims Aviation of Reims, France. In 1963, Cessna produced its 50,000th airplane, a Cessna 172.\nCessna's first business jet, the Cessna Citation I, performed its maiden flight on September 15, 1969.\nCessna produced its 100,000th single-engine airplane in 1975.\nIn 1985, Cessna ceased to be an independent company. It was purchased by General Dynamics Corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary. Production of the Cessna Caravan began. General Dynamics in turn sold Cessna to Textron in 1992.\nLate in 2007, Cessna purchased the bankrupt Columbia Aircraft company for US$26.4M and would continue production of the Columbia 350 and 400 as the Cessna 350 and Cessna 400 at the Columbia factory in Bend, Oregon. However, production of both aircraft had ended by 2018.\nChinese production controversy.\nOn November 27, 2007, Cessna announced the then-new Cessna 162 would be built in China by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I), a Chinese government-owned consortium of aircraft manufacturers. Cessna reported that the decision was made to save money and also that the company had no more plant capacity in the United States at the time. Cessna received much negative feedback for this decision, with complaints centering on the recent quality problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs and China's less than friendly political relationship with the United States. The customer backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign. In early 2009, the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the United States. In the end, the Cessna 162 was not a commercial success and only a small number were delivered before production was cancelled.\n2008\u20132010 economic crisis.\nThe company's business suffered notably during the late-2000s recession, laying off more than half its workforce between January 2009 and September 2010.\nOn November 4, 2008, Cessna's parent company, Textron, indicated that Citation production would be reduced from the original 2009 target of 535 \"due to continued softening in the global economic environment\" and that this would result in an undetermined number of lay-offs at Cessna.\nOn November 8, 2008, at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) Expo, CEO Jack Pelton indicated that sales of Cessna aircraft to individual buyers had fallen, but piston and turboprop sales to businesses had not. \"While the economic slowdown has created a difficult business environment, we are encouraged by brisk activity from new and existing propeller fleet operators placing almost 200 orders for 2009 production aircraft,\" Pelton stated.\nBeginning in January 2009, a total of 665 jobs were cut at Cessna's Wichita and Bend, Oregon plants. The Cessna factory at Independence, Kansas, which builds the Cessna piston-engined aircraft and the Cessna Mustang, did not see any layoffs, but one third of the workforce at the former Columbia Aircraft facility in Bend was laid off. This included 165 of the 460 employees who built the Cessna 350 and 400. The remaining 500 jobs were eliminated at the main Cessna Wichita plant.\nIn January 2009, the company laid off an additional 2,000 employees, bringing the total to 4,600. The job cuts included 120 at the Bend, Oregon, facility reducing the plant that built the Cessna 350 and 400 to fewer than half the number of workers that it had when Cessna bought it. Other cuts included 200 at the Independence, Kansas, plant that builds the single-engined Cessnas and the Mustang, reducing that facility to 1,300 workers.\nOn April 29, 2009, the company suspended the Citation Columbus program and closed the Bend, Oregon, facility. The Columbus program was finally cancelled in early July 2009. The company reported, \"Upon additional analysis of the business jet market related to this product offering, we decided to formally cancel further development of the Citation Columbus\". With the 350 and 400 production moving to Kansas, the company indicated that it would lay off 1,600 more workers, including the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant and up to 700 workers from the Columbus program.\nIn early June 2009, Cessna laid off an additional 700 salaried employees, bringing the total number of lay-offs to 7,600, which was more than half the company's workers at the time.\nThe company closed its three Columbus, Georgia, manufacturing facilities between June 2010 and December 2011. The closures included the new facility that was opened in August 2008 at a cost of US$25M, plus the McCauley Propeller Systems plant. These closures resulted in total job losses of 600 in Georgia. Some of the work was relocated to Cessna's Independence, Kansas, or Mexican facilities.\nCessna's parent company, Textron, posted a loss of US$8M in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by continuing low sales at Cessna, which were down 44%. Half of Cessna's workforce remained laid-off and CEO Jack Pelton stated that he expected the recovery to be long and slow.\nIn September 2010, a further 700 employees were laid off, bringing the total to 8,000 jobs lost. CEO Jack Pelton indicated this round of layoffs was due to a \"stalled [and] lackluster economy\" and noted that while the number of orders cancelled for jets had been decreasing, new orders had not met expectations. Pelton added, \"our strategy is to defend and protect our current markets while investing in products and services to secure our future, but we can do this only if we succeed in restructuring our processes and reducing our costs.\"\n2010s.\nOn May 2, 2011, CEO Jack J. Pelton retired. The new CEO, Scott A. Ernest, started on May 31, 2011. Ernest joined Textron after 29 years at General Electric, where he had most recently served as vice president and general manager, global supply chain for GE Aviation. Ernest previously worked for Textron CEO Scott Donnelly when both worked at General Electric.\nIn September 2011, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed a US$2.4\u00a0million fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in Chihuahua, Mexico. Excess humidity meant that the parts did not cure correctly and quality assurance did not detect the problems. The failure to follow procedures resulted in the delamination in flight of a section of one Cessna 400's wing skin from the spar while the aircraft was being flown by an FAA test pilot. The aircraft was landed safely. The FAA also discovered 82 other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company's quality assurance. The investigation resulted in an emergency Airworthiness Directive that affected 13 Cessna 400s.\nSince March 2012, Cessna has been pursuing building business jets in China as part of a joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The company stated that it intends to eventually build all aircraft models in China, saying \"The agreements together pave the way for a range of business jets, utility single-engine turboprops and single-engine piston aircraft to be manufactured and certified in China.\"\nIn late April 2012, the company added 150 workers in Wichita as a result of anticipated increased demand for aircraft production. Overall, they have cut more than 6000 jobs in the Wichita plant since 2009.\nIn March 2014, Cessna ceased operations as a company and instead became a brand of Textron Aviation.\nMarketing initiatives.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Cessna's marketing department followed the lead of Detroit automakers and came up with many unique marketing terms in an effort to differentiate its product line from their competitors.\nOther manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of the marketing terms, but Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s.\nGenerally, the names of Cessna models do not follow a theme, but there is usually logic to the numbering: the 100 series are the light singles, the 200s are the heftier, the 300s are light to medium twins, the 400s have \"wide oval\" cabin-class accommodation and the 500s are jets. Many Cessna models have names starting with C for the sake of alliteration (e.g. Citation, Crusader, Chancellor).\nCompany terminology.\nCessna marketing terminology includes:\nAircraft models.\nIn October 2020, Textron Aviation was producing the following Cessna-branded models:"

He began his professional career in 1964, working with still-life objects,\nand eventually broadened his horizons by doing portraits. Spindel also incorporates baseball memorabilia in collage form in some of his work. He is probably best known for photographing John Lennon and Yoko Ono during Lennon's last recording sessions for Double Fantasy in 1980.\nBiography.\nSpindel grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 1964 (studying under such photographers as Minor White, professor Leslie Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia, Ralph Hattersley, and Robert Bagby). He worked as a photo assistant for six years until his employer at that time, Tosh Matsumoto, encouraged him to open his own studio.\nThroughout his commercial career, Spindel was featured in major newspapers, magazines and art publications. Television shows in the U.S. and abroad have featured segments on his approach to photography.\nAfter 28 years in commercial advertising, Spindel began creating an interactive body of work called \"Rebuses.\" Webster\u2019s dictionary defines a rebus as \"representation of words or phrases by means of pictures or objects whose names resemble those words or phrases; a form of riddle composed of such pictures.\" Spindel's rebuses have been quoted as being \"unexpectedly different and more fun than finding one of Hirshfeld\u2019s Ninas\". Ranging in subjects from all-time favorite celebrities to frequently used everyday expressions, Spindel's rebuses are an outpouring of his sense of humor.\nNotable fans and collectors of Spindel's work include: Charlton Heston, Hillary Clinton, Dr. Ruth Westheimer (Dr. Ruth), Marty Allen, Stiller and Meara, Anne Jackson, Eli Wallach, Chuck Connors, Donald Trump, Jerry Lewis, Lou Jacobi, Billy Crystal and Kate Hepburn. Regis Philbin said, \u201cDavid is a little eccentric but you have to put up with it when someone is a genius\u201d. Bette Davis once said, \u201cDavid\u2019s art is wondrous\u201d. Michael Eisner thought his photography was extraordinary and recommended it to the sports division of Disney. Joe DiMaggio greatly admired Spindel\u2019s talent and posed for a portrait with his own personal memorabilia.\nIn 1992, Abbeville Press released The Bronx Bombers and The Boston Red Sox, the first two titles in the award-winning, eight-volume Major League Memories series. Each book chronicles a major league baseball team\u2019s history, in scrapbook form, from inception to present day.\nIn 2014 Master PIece puzzle commissioned him to create one of his collages on the life of John Wayne. It is titled \"Remembering the Duke\". They also licensed 4 of his sports images for 1000 piece puzzles.\nOn the eve of John Lennon's birthday in 2015, CNN licensed several of his photographs for a special documentary they were creating.\nSpindel is also known for donating his photographs to charitable organizations. He has raised funds for the Leukemia Society of America, The Mid Hudson Children\u2019s Museum, A.L.S., Baseball Assistance Team (BAT), Lupus, The Heart Fund, Yogi Berra\u2019s and Phil Rizzuto\u2019s favorite charities (Handicapped Boy Scouts of Southern NJ and St. Joseph\u2019s School for the Blind), and numerous family shelters.\nSpindel's original photographs created for posters are featured at The National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nHe now resides in Anthem, Arizona."

        "text": "Talita \"Tat\u00e1\" Werneck Arguelhes (; ; born 11 August 1983), is a Brazilian actress, television presenter, comedian, musician, and former VJ.\nCareer.\nShe began her acting studies at the age of 9 and subsequently appeared in her first theatrical performance at 11. Her debut in a televised program occurred in 2008, when she joined the cast of \"Dilemas de Irene\". Two years later, she joined the team of \"Quinta Categoria\", formerly MTV Brasil, and participated in several other station's programs between 2010 and 2012.\nWerneck only found nationwide fame in 2013, after landing the role of a comedic hoochie Valdirene who longed to marry a rich man in the soap opera \"Amor \u00e0 Vida\", broadcast by Rede Globo, Brazil\u2019s main television station.

        "title": "Jeremy Scott",
        "text": "Jeremy Scott (born August 8, 1975) is an American fashion designer. He is the sole owner of his namesake label, and from October 2013 to March 2023 was the creative director of the fashion house Moschino. Since launching his brand in Paris in 1997, Scott has built a reputation as \"pop culture's most irreverent designer\", and \"fashion's last rebel\".\nKnown for his designs of clothes, accessories and footwear for Adidas and Moschino, Scott has consistently worked with various celebrities such as Bj\u00f6rk, Madonna, Katy Perry, CL and 2NE1, Nicki Minaj, Fergie, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, ASAP Rocky, M.I.A., Rita Ora, Cardi B, and Grimes. As an early proponent of blending high fashion with street style, he creates designs often incorporating pop-culture icons.\nEarly life and education.\nScott was born in 1975 in Kansas City, Missouri. He grew up partly on a farm in Lowry City and partly in a suburb outside Kansas City. Jeremy was interested in fashion from an early age. At 14, he began studying French and took night courses in Japanese because he was determined to become a fashion designer. In high school, he drew fashion in his notebooks and was bullied because of his dressing style. He discovered runway fashion in \"Details\", looking up to Jean Paul Gaultier, Martin Margiela, Thierry Mugler, and Franco Moschino as role models. In 1992, Scott moved to New York to study fashion design at Pratt Institute, one of the city's Art and Design colleges, where he wore sci-fi-inspired clothes, \"1880s vs 1980s\" outfits, and shredded and decaying clothes. Scott did an internship in the New York offices of Aeffe, the company that owns Moschino.\nCareer.\nDebut in Paris.\nAfter graduating in 1996, Scott moved to Paris. While looking for a job in the fashion industry, he was forced to scrounge meals and sleep in the Metro. When he ran into a PR for Jean Paul Gaultier who liked his hair (Scott cut his own hair since he was five), he got a job promoting parties at a nightclub. Not having any luck with fashion jobs, he decided to create his own brand.\nThe following season, in 1997, Jeremy Scott, the brand, made its debut in a bar near Bastille. The show was based on the J. G. Ballard book and David Cronenberg film \"Crash\", with most of the material coming from paper hospital gowns. Scraps of fabric from the Porte de Clignancourt flea market resembling garbage bags were used in the follow-up show, all in black, which was described by Scott as \"Blade Runner, trash bags and the apocalypse.\" The collection was later exhibited in the influential Parisian shop Colette, which has carried Jeremy Scott ever since.\nHis third collection, all in white, was a critical hit. It won awards and attracted Mario Testino, the editor of French Vogue, and Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, a French stylist, art director and photographer. The white show was the first runway appearance of the soon-to-be-supermodel Devon Aoki, who was only 13 at the time. (Twenty years later, the pair would collaborate again on Scott's Autumn/Winter 2016 campaign.) Bj\u00f6rk was an early adopter, wearing an angel dress from the white show for her Homogenic world tour. Scott would provide costumes on several of her tours.\nIn the same year, Scott made a show about 1980s decadence (sable, shoulder pads, big hair, gold lam\u00e9) as maybe the first designer to revive the eighties. The models' unbalanced heels were designed by Christian Louboutin. Opposing the prevalent minimalism, the show was panned by Vogue and others. Scott himself considers \"the gold show\" as the hardest moment of his career.\nHis 1998 spring collection titled \"Duty Free Glamour\" featured flight-attendant inspired looks and khaki jackets plastered with logos. Writing in \"The Times\", the fashion critic Cathy Horyn pointed out the original use of the experience of a Midwesterner as a foil to jet set glamour. Karl Lagerfeld said that Scott was the only person working in fashion who could take over Chanel after he left.\nIn 2001 Scott left Paris for Los Angeles. It was seen as a surprising move, since Los Angeles was not yet a fashion capital at the time.\nThe Adidas collaboration.\nScott had cemented his reputation as a cult label with fervid fans, particularly in Asia, but he was still on the fringe of the fashion establishment, as he was considered neither \"serious\" nor \"commercial\". He closed one show in 2001 by throwing fake banknotes with his face printed on them into the audience. At the close of another show, he shouted: \"Vive l\u2019avant-garde!\", and left yellow T-shirts stamped with the message on every seat.\nIn 2006, Scott started his ongoing collaboration with the French leather-goods company Longchamp, which makes bags for front-row guests at his fashion shows.\nScott first worked with Adidas in 2002 for the \"!Signed\" project, for which he created a silk jacquard with a motif of money scattered around with his own likeness replacing that of George Washington. The design was on the Adidas classic high top model, the Forum. The shoe was handmade in the Adidas factory in Scheinfeld, Germany. There were only 100 pairs made: 50 went to Scott and 50 went to Adidas. Scott would revisit the design with Money Wings 2.0 in Fall/Winter 2013.\nHowever, his best-known Adidas collaboration came in 2008, when Adidas Originals launched Scott's collection of footwear and apparel that included JS Wings (winged high-tops) and JS Bears (furry sneakers with teddy bear heads). With early co-signs from rappers like Lil Wayne, Scott's footwear gained him mass appeal. His sneakers are considered \"some of the most eye-catching sneakers ever seen\", making \"an indisputable imprint on the shoe landscape\". Over the years, his iconic wings adorned many different Adidas silhouettes. He also applied them to other objects for other clients, including Smart cars and baby prams.\nHe collaborated with Swatch in 2011, creating three watch designs that were hailed as the return of Swatch to its \"uber-fun Eighties roots\" with Scott's \"pop aesthetic, fun twist and overstated form\".\nScott starred in the Adidas 2012 print and video campaign with Nicki Minaj, Sky Ferreira and 2NE1. Madonna's dancers in the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show wore Jeremy Scott track suits for Adidas Originals.\nIn June 2012, Adidas decided that a pair of sneakers designed by Scott called the \"JS Roundhouse Mids\" would not be sold after the shoes were criticised for their bright yellow handcuffs which, as some believed, were \"shackles\" alluding to slavery. Scott denied that the shoes had anything to do with slavery, stating it was a reference to the children's toy My Pet Monster.\nFor his Fall 2012 collection, Scott introduced 1990s nostalgia, with several computer references like a printed gloved-hand cursor and '90s-era Mac screenshots. He made a show-closing homage to Lisa Frank with a vacuum-formed plexiglass bustier encrusted in hundreds of Frank stickers.\nIn February 2013, Scott plagiarized designs from Santa Cruz Skateboards. Santa Cruz and Scott reached a settlement whereby Scott ceased production of his collection.\nHe debuted his first fragrance for Adidas on February 1, 2015, in a glass replica of his Adidas winged sneakers. In the 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\", the character Harley Quinn wears high-top heels from Jeremy Scott's 2014 collaboration with Adidas.\nCreative director at Moschino.\nIn October 2013 Scott became Moschino's creative director. After turning down several other offers, he chose the Italian label because it had a similarly irreverent approach, its founder Franco Moschino seeing fashion as a form of protest.\nAfter redesigning the entire Pre-Fall collection, Scott showed his first Moschino collection in fall 2014. He re-told the fashion gags of Franco Moschino (rubbish bags, witty slogans, beefeater hats) through the eyes of an American (McDonald's handbags, popcorn dresses, nutrition-label ballgowns, SpongeBob SquarePants fur coats). An example of his proceeding was a vis-a-vis jacket in McDonald's colors (ketchup-red and bright yellow) with a matching quilted leather handbag bearing a golden \"M\" in the shape of a heart. His first Moschino fragrance was called Moschino Toy. The bottle literally looked like a teddy bear, with the spray nozzle under its head.\nIn his 2015 manifesto in \"The Guardian\", Scott described his approach to American consumer culture: \"An image of Mickey Mouse is understood in Mumbai, Timbuktu and Los Angeles in the same way. It's a clear message even if you subvert it by, say, putting Mickey ears on an army helmet (as I did in 2007)... A lot of my collections are informed by nostalgia.\" In fact, his fashion is often humorous: a 2016 show included a handbag that looked like a box of Marlboro Reds and bore the warning \"Fashion Kills\".\nIn August 2015, Scott was sued along with Moschino for copyright infringement in relation to the Moschino Fall/Winter 2015 clothing line. The garments in question included \"literal copies\" of the plaintiff's work, according to the original complaint filed. The suit was settled out of court.\nHis Moschino Fall/Winter 2016 collection was inspired by the Florentine Bonfire of the Vanities of 1497. Dresses featured shards of mirrors, a fallen grand chandelier, and the innards of a destroyed grand piano. In a technical first, a few dresses were followed by trails of smoke on the runway because of integrated smoke machines inside them. At the same time, the Fall 2016 collection of his personal brand in New York included cartoony Max Headroom and rockabilly guitar prints, glitzy high-heeled cowboy boots, and cow print denim. It was called \"Cowboys and Poodles\" after a vintage store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles that introduced the 1950s rockabilly culture to the 1980s punks.\nScott created a TV commercial for the Moschino Barbie doll, which he wrote and art-directed, based on toy commercials of the eighties and nineties. It attracted attention as the first Barbie commercial to feature a boy. For the Moschino Spring/Summer 2017 collection, Scott commented on the internet generation's fixation on 2D screens.

        "text": "Larimichthys crocea, commonly called the large yellow croaker, yellow croaker or croceine croaker, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Sciaenidae, the drums and croakers. This species is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. \nTaxonomy.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" was first formally described as \"Sciaena crocea\" in 1846 by the Scottish naval surgeon, Arctic explorer and naturalist Sir John Richardson with its type locality given as \"Canton, China\". The genus \"Larimichthys\", to which this species belongs, has been placed in the subfamily Otolithinae by some workers, but the 5th edition of \"Fishes of the World\" does not recognise subfamilies within the Sciaenidae which it places in the order Acanthuriformes. In 2011 specimens which were thought to be \"L. crocea\" were taken off Terengganu in eastern Peninsular Malaysia but these have now been classified as a separate valid species \"Larimichthys terengganui\".\nEtymology.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" has the specific name \"crocea\" which means \"saffron\" and is an allusion to yellow colours on the body and fins.\nDescription.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" has a dorsal fin which is supported by 9 or 10 spines and between 30 and 35 soft rays while the anal fin is supported by 2 spines and between 7 and 9, typically 8, soft rays. The soft rayed parts of these fins are largely covered in scales. The overall colour of fresh specimens is gold. This species reaches a maximum published total length of .\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" is found in the marginal seas of East Asia from western Japan and Korea to the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and northern South China Sea. It generally thrives in temperate coastal waters and often also in brackish estuaries, and is found on muddy-sandy bottoms. \nUtilisation and conservation.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" was once an abundant commercial fish off East and South China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, its population collapsed in the 1970s due to overfishing. Fishing boats landed 56,000 tonnes of \"Larimichthys crocea\" in 2008, and 91,000 tonnes in 2013. The species is now aquafarmed in China, and production has grown to 105,000 tonnes by 2013. Farms have experienced outbreaks of \"Nocardia seriolae\" infections.\nThe IUCN classifies this species as Critically Endangered as there has been no recovery in the population and there is no evidence that the fishery for this species is sustainable.\nGenome.\n\"Larimichthys crocea\" is an important enough commercial species to have its genome mapped in 2014. On 6 January 2015 it became the 200th organism to have its genome annotated by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline."

        "title": "Graveyard Girl",
        "text": "\"Graveyard Girl\" is a song by French electronic act M83. Written by Anthony Gonzalez with his brother Yann, it was released in April 2008 as the second single from M83's fifth studio album, \"Saturdays = Youth\".\nBackground and composition.\nAnthony Gonzalez cited English band Tears for Fears and Scottish band Cocteau Twins, as well as John Hughes teen films \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Sixteen Candles\", as inspirations for \"Saturdays = Youth\". \nA girl resembling Molly Ringwald appears on the album cover, and the lyrics and music video for \"Graveyard Girl\" further highlight these influences. \n\"I wanted to have the feeling of a teenager mixed with this period of the Eighties,\" Gonzalez said. The song tells the story of a goth girl Gonzalez once knew who \"worships Satan\" but \"dreams of a sister like Molly Ringwald.\"\nCritical reception.\n\"Spin\"'s Mosi Reeves called \"Graveyard Girl\" one of the album's \"few compelling songs.\"\nDave Hughes of \"Slant Magazine\" said the song is \"certainly the most typically, successfully pop moment this difficult, often transcendent act has ever produced.\" \n\"Pitchfork\"'s Amy Phillips wrote that \"Anthony Gonzalez makes the teen years seem idyllic, a time in life when all emotion is pure and beautiful,\" and that the song is \"melodramatic, overblown, and even a little bit silly. But then again, so is high school.\" \nJer Fairall of \"PopMatters\" suggested that on \"Graveyard Girl\", M83 found \"pure pop perfection by dipping into the pool of mid-'80s synth-pop.\" \nTreble's Tyler Parks noted: \"It is quite possible that no one has ever sung quite so sweetly of someone worshipping Satan.\"\nOther versions and appearances.\nA remix by French DJ-producer Yuksek serves as the single's B-side. ParkerLab's Dusted remix appears on M83's \"We Own the Sky\" EP, released in 2009. \"Graveyard Girl\" is used in the 2010 film \"The Last Song\"."
